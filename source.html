<h2 class=no-num>Status of this Document</h2>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>This document is a preliminary draft of a specification for HTML editing
APIs, mainly defining [[selections]], <code>execCommand()</code> and related
functionality.  It replaces a couple of old sections of the <a
href=http://www.whatwg.org/html>HTML</a> specification, and the [[selection]]
part of the old DOM Range specification.  Issues that don't necessarily need
discussion should preferably be <a
href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/enter_bug.cgi?product=WebAppsWG&component=HTML+Editing+APIs>filed
in the issue tracker</a>.  Feedback that needs discussion should preferably be
sent to <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/>the
public-webapps list</a>, with the string "[editing]" somewhere in the subject,
CC'd to <a href=mailto:ayg@aryeh.name>ayg@aryeh.name</a> to make sure I see it.
I will handle all feedback I'm aware of, either addressing it immediately or
filing a bug if it needs longer-term consideration and is not already filed.

<p>This specification, along with the accompanying JavaScript implementation
and tests, may be used under the terms of the <a
href=http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>CC0 1.0 Universal
License</a>.  Thus anyone may reuse, modify, and redistribute them without

<h2 class=no-num>Table of contents</h2>
<!--toc-->

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>This specification defines commands to edit HTML documents programmatically.
The APIs specified here were originally introduced in Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, but have subsequently been copied by other browsers in a haphazard
and imprecise fashion.  Although the behavior specified here does not exactly
match any browser at the time of writing, it can serve as a target to converge
to in the future.

<p>Where the reasoning behind the specification is of interest, such as when
major preexisting rendering engines are known not to match it, the reasoning is
available by clicking the "comments" button on the right (requires JavaScript).
If you have questions about why the specification says something, check the
comments first.  They're sometimes longer than the specification text itself,
and commonly record what the major browsers do and other essential information.

<p>The principles I've used for writing this specification so far are:

<ul>
  <li>If all browsers that implement a particular feature agree on some detail
  of how it works, match them unless there's very good reason not to.  When
  it's not clear what behavior is best, try to follow the implementations with
  the most market share.  But if one browser's behavior is clearly better than
  the others', go with the better behavior.

  <li>If a command is issued to format some text in a particular way, we will
  format the text that way no matter what.  If the user clicks the "bold"
  button, they don't care that the text didn't become bold because of an
  external CSS rule or for any other reason, they only care that it didn't
  work.  The only exception (beyond where it's simply impossible, like
  propagated text-decorations we can't remove) is that we don't try to override
  !important rules from external stylesheets, although we also don't go out of
  our way to respect them.

  <li>When we're given a presentational command like "bold", don't modify
  anything other than presentational markup related to that command.  If an
  element has non-presentational attributes like id or class, don't split it up
  or remove it or anything.  At most convert it to a span, if it's some type of
  presentational element.  ("Presentational" here really means "browsers
  produce it in response to execCommand() so we need to treat it as
  presentational", so it includes things like [[strong]] and [[em]].)  Of
  course, in some cases we have to remove elements, like when merging two
  blocks.

  <li>Don't interfere with more markup than necessary.  If the user modifies
  only a small run of text, don't go around simplifying ancestors or siblings
  or whatever unless it's necessary to produce simpler markup in the place that
  was actually modified.

  <li>But if we are already changing around something's style, convert existing
  styles to the preferred format.  For instance, we use {{code<|b>}} for bold
  (if the CSS styling flag is false), and convert {{code<|strong>}} and
  {{code|<span style="font-weight: bold">}} if we happen to be modifying
  that node anyway.

  <li>Try not to make the document less conforming than it originally was.  If
  we happen to make it more conforming, good, although we don't have to go out
  of our way to do that.  In some cases we do make the document less
  conforming, generally because there's some clear use-case that requires it or
  because it matches existing browsers behavior.  (For instance, see the
  styleWithCSS = false mode, and the fact that insertImage doesn't add an
  alt attribute, etc.)

  <li>Keep the markup as concise as possible.  (I've received feedback that
  this is very important to authors.)  Ideally, the markup should look as
  simple and neat as what a human would have produced by hand-editing.  We do
  complicated manipulation to pull styles down from ancestors rather than
  having to use inline CSS, and make sure to tidy up any styles on elements
  that we happen to be modifying anyway.  Previous principles take precedence
  over this one, however.
</ul>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<h3>General remarks</h3>
<!-- @{ -->

<p>There are two groups of tests currently associated with this specification:
selection tests, and command tests.  The command tests are available in two
formats, development tests and conformance tests.  This has a lot to do with
the history of how the specification was developed: selection was originally
part of the defunct <a href=http://html5.org/specs/dom-range.html>DOM Range</a>
spec, while the command parts were developed on their own.  The selection
things have been merged into the command spec, but neither the spec text nor
the tests have been fully unified at the time of this writing.

<p>Thus the selection tests live in their own directory, <a
href=selecttest/>selecttest/</a>.  They use the standard <a
href=http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html/file/tip/tests/resources/testharness.js>testharness.js</a>
framework developed by James Graham.  They're entirely self-contained, sharing
nothing with the command tests (except invoking the testharness.js library).
At the time of this writing, they're not nearly as comprehensive as the command
tests, although they do test some functionality comprehensively.

<p>On the other hand, the command-related part of this specification is
developed in tandem with a more or less complete <a
href=implementation.js>JavaScript implementation</a>.  The implementation is
used for creating tests, of two different types: development tests and
conformance tests.  The two types of test share most of the same code, starting
with the multi-thousand-line implementation itself.  The actual tests run are
largely the same in either case, but the way they're run is very different.

<p>The development tests were the original ones, and were designed to assist in
writing the specification from scratch.  Given an input, they print out the
spec's and browser's output to allow manual inspection.  They can store the
spec's output and will raise an alert if it changed since the last run, as a
form of regression testing, but they don't print out counts of passed/failed
tests.  They are not designed to run exactly the same across browsers and are
tolerant of minor variations.  Development tests are likely not very useful for
anyone other than the spec's editor.

<p>Conformance tests were added later.  They run the same tests as the
development tests, but in an entirely non-interactive format, using the <a
href=http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html/file/tip/tests/resources/testharness.js>testharness.js</a>
framework like the selection tests.  They always run the same set of tests,
don't vary behavior between browsers (hopefully), and are unforgiving of any
deviation.  However, they're significantly more cumbersome to set up and use,
so they're less useful for developing the specification itself.

<p>There's a suite of predefined tests for each command (~30&ndash;300 at the
time of this writing).  These are the only tests run for the conformance tests,
and in the regression tests they can be run by clicking the "Run tests" button.
For the regression tests, you can also enter your own tests manually in the box
provided.  In any event, the test input is a snippet of HTML, which must have a
selection marked in it.  There are three ways to mark a selection's start or
end:

<ol>
  <li>Square brackets mark a selection inside a text node, like
  {{code|<b>foo[bar]baz</b>}} for a selection whose start and end nodes are in
  the text node {{code|foobarbaz}}, with start offset 3 and end offset 6.  Do
  not use square brackets where there's no text node: {{code|<b>[]</b>}} is
  bad, {{code|<b>{}</b>}} is correct.

  <li>Curly braces mark a selection inside an element, like
  {{code|<b>{foobarbaz</b>} }} for a selection whose start node is the element
  {{code<|b>}}, whose start offset is 0, whose end node is the root of the
  editable region, and whose end offset is 1.  Do not use curly braces in the
  middle of a text node: <code title>foo{bar}baz</code> is bad, <code
  title>foo[bar]baz</code> is correct.

  <li>The <code title>data-start</code> and <code title>data-end</code>
  attributes mark a selection inside an element if a curly brace can't be put
  there in text/html.  For instance,
  {{code|<table><tr>{<td>foo</td>}</tr></table>}} doesn't work because when the
  fragment is parsed, the curly braces end up outside the table.  Instead, you
  have to do {{code|<table><tr data-start=0 data-end=1><td>foo</table>}}.
</ol>

<p>Every input must have exactly one start marker and one end marker, which
will be removed from the DOM before the test is run.  You can mix and match
marker types, e.g., <code title>[foo}</code>.

<p>There is one special test type that behaves differently, "multitest".  This
allows running several tests in succession, which is needed at least for
testing the effect of commands' <span>state override</span> or <span>value
override</span>.  The syntax is JSON, and looks like

<pre>
[<var>HTML input</var>,
  [<var>command name 1</var>, <var>command value 1</var>],
  [<var>command name 2</var>, <var>command value 2</var>],
  . . .]</pre>

<p>where all the variables are properly-quoted JSON strings.  <code
title>queryCommand*()</code> are not run for multitests.

<p>In all cases, prefixing the test string (or the first string in the test
array, for arrays) with "!" has a special effect.  The "!" will be stripped,
and the test will be added to an array of bad tests.  These tests will be
omitted from the <a href=#conformance-tests>conformance tests</a>.  This is
used to mark tests where the reference implementation is known to currently
give bad results, either because of a bug in the reference implementation or a
bug in the spec.  Bad tests will still be run as <a
href=#development-tests>development tests</a>.

<p>Commands that are expected to vary significantly based on the value of the
<span>CSS styling flag</span> are run twice.  The first time runs
<code title>execCommand("styleWithCSS", false, "false")</code> before every
command, and the second runs <code title>execCommand("styleWithCSS", false,
"true")</code> before every command.  All other commands other than multitests
run <code title>execCommand("styleWithCSS", false, "false")</code> before every
command.  The extra tests are not run as regression tests, in IE or Opera,
because they don't implement <span>the <code title>styleWithCSS</code>
command</span> (but of course the conformance tests always all run).

<p>The implementation is also used for an actual <a href=editor.html>rich-text
editor</a>, but it's currently more of a toy than anything.  Significant
functionality is probably broken, especially outside of Gecko/WebKit.  I might
spend some more time getting it to work right, but it's certainly not going to
be very useful on real-world sites, since there's no way any of this stuff will
work in IE8.

<!-- @} -->
<h3 id=development-tests>Command development tests</h3>
<!-- @{ -->

<p>The development tests are mostly useful for developing the spec itself, not
for use by authors or browser implementers.  They consist of a suite of fully
automated tests plus a few separate suites of manual tests.  The tests are:

<ul>
  <li><a href=autoimplementation.html>autoimplementation.html</a>: Fully
  automated tests for pretty much all commands.

  <li><a href=deletetest.html>deletetest.html</a>: Manual tests for <span>the
  <code title>delete</code> command</span>.

  <li><a href=forwarddeletetest.html>forwarddeletetest.html</a>: Manual tests
  for <span>the <code title>forwardDelete</code> command</span>.

  <li><a href=insertlinebreaktest.html>insertlinebreaktest.html</a>: Manual
  tests for <span>the <code title>insertLineBreak</code> command</span>.

  <li><a href=insertparagraphtest.html>insertparagraphtest.html</a>: Manual
  tests for <span>the <code title>insertParagraph</code> command</span>.

  <li><a href=inserttexttest.html>inserttexttest.html</a>: Manual tests for
  <span>the <code title>insertText</code> command</span>, with <var>value</var>
  "a".

  <li><a href=inserttext2test.html>inserttext2test.html</a>: Manual tests for
  <span>the <code title>insertText</code> command</span>, with <var>value</var>
  " ".
</ul>

<p>The automated tests run the JavaScript implementation of the specification
on a particular input, then run the browser's implementation on the same input
for comparison.  The results of running automated tests are placed in a table,
with rows marked as passing or failing based on whether the browser output is
"close enough" to the spec output.  Since the tests are designed for debugging
the spec rather than actually testing conformance, minor variations are allowed
to avoid having browsers fail many tests for uninteresting reasons.  Passes and
fails are based only on <code>execCommand()</code> output, not <code
title>queryCommand*()</code>: the latter is sanity-checked, and colored green
or red if it's known to be right or wrong on general principle, but spec and
browser output are not compared.

<p>The tests will optionally store the specification's result for each test in
<code title>localStorage</code>, and will raise an alert for any new test (no
stored output), any test whose spec output is different from the last run, and
any test whose spec output is otherwise clearly bad (e.g., producing a
non-serializable DOM).  This is mostly useful for debugging and
regression-testing the spec itself, and is probably not interesting to anyone
other than me.

<p>When a test runs, first the code sets up a contenteditable div with the
given contents and sets the selection as requested.  Then it runs
<code>queryCommandIndeterm()</code>, <code>queryCommandState()</code>, and
<code>queryCommandValue()</code>, and their values are noted.  Then it runs
<code>execCommand()</code>.  Finally, it runs
<code>queryCommandIndeterm()</code>, <code>queryCommandState()</code>, and
<code>queryCommandValue()</code> again.  Then it adds the output to the table.

<p>The manual tests are much like the automated tests, with some key
differences.  They only test one command each, with one input value (if
applicable).  When a test is run, everything proceeds as in the automated case,
but instead of running <code>execCommand()</code> for the browser tests, the
user is asked to hit the appropriate key (backspace, delete, enter, etc.).
Thus when running the tests for the first time, the user has to hit a key
repeatedly, perhaps a few hundred times.  The browser's result is then cached
in <code title>localStorage</code> so no manual intervention is required on
subsequent runs except for newly-added tests, but the cached entries can be
cleared if necessary.

<p>The development tests have been tested and largely work in the latest
versions (at the time of this writing) of IE, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.
Since the implementation of the spec is in JavaScript, it's vulnerable to bugs
in browsers' JavaScript implementations.  I work around or warn about some of
these, but not all.  The most correct results will probably be in Firefox or
Chrome: both IE and Opera have serious known bugs that corrupt spec output for
many tests.  The tests are still useful for reviewing the browser output, but
spec output in those browsers should be sanity-checked and compared against
another browser's spec output in case of doubt.

<!-- @} -->
<h3 id=conformance-tests>Command conformance tests</h3>
<!-- @{ -->

<p>The conformance tests operate more like one would expect from tests.  Once
generated, they consist of a single page, <a
href=conformancetest/runtest.html>conformancetest/runtest.html</a>, which runs
all the tests and prints out a table of passes and fails.  Like many other
recent web standards suites, they use the <a
href=http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html/file/tip/tests/resources/testharness.js>testharness.js</a>
framework, and browser implementers should be able to make them part of their
automated regression test frameworks.

<p>For manual inspection, a version of the conformance tests is also available
that runs only some of the tests at once: <a
href=conformancetest/splitruntest.html>conformancetest/splitruntest.html</a>.
This runs only one group of tests at a time, which takes only a few seconds
instead of a minute or more.  This makes debugging particular tests much
faster.  In all other respects, it should behave identically to runtest.html.

<p>Unlike the development tests, the conformance tests don't run the JavaScript
implementation as part of the test.  Instead, the tests' expected values are
generated by a separate page, <a
href=conformancetest/gentest.html>conformancetest/gentest.html</a>.  That page
will output the expected values for all tests in a format to be copied to <a
href=conformancetest/data.js>conformancetest/data.js</a>, where it will be used
by runtest.html.

<p>This separation has a few benefits.  First of all, it means the conformance
tests take a long time to generate, but run <em>much</em> faster than the
development tests: on the order of one minute instead of five or more.
(Browser implementations of {{code|execCommand()}} are currently much faster
than the spec's JS reference implementation, it seems.)  Second of all, it
means that all browsers are running against the same expected results.  Third
of all, the fact that all expected results are saved in a file allows much more
systematic regression testing of the spec and the reference implementation.
Changes in expected results will be recorded in the spec's version history and
can be matched up to changes in the reference implementation or the spec,
instead of being stored transiently in the spec editor's {{code|localStorage}}
and then lost.

<p>There are a couple of disadvantages as well.  For one thing, new tests can't
easily be added live, so the conformance tests aren't useful for experimenting
with how implementations work.  For another thing, the tests' expected results
can only be generated all at once (not per-command), which takes minutes.  A
third issue is that they provide no useful feedback at all about user actions
such as hitting Enter: they tell you what <span>the <code
title>insertParagraph</code> command</span> does in the browser, but not
whether it matches up to any user action.  Commands like <span>the <code
title>insertText</code> command</span> just fail all tests in most browsers.
Thus they don't replace the manual development tests at all.  (Manual
conformance tests will eventually be added.)

<p>As might be expected, browsers don't generate exactly the same expected
results from the tests.  Clearly incorrect expected results (like a DOM that
doesn't round-trip through text/html) are automatically rejected, with a
printed warning, but some discrepancies remain.  At the time of this writing,
Firefox 8.0a2 and Chrome 15 dev generate identical results, except that Firefox
omits one test (due to <a
href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578141>incorrect
serialization of {{code|<xmp>}}</a>) and Chrome gets one test wrong (due to a
<a href=https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67424>style resolution
bug</a>).  Thus I generate the tests right now in Firefox, since all its
generated tests are at least correct.  IE9 and Opera 11.50 don't yet generate
or run the tests usefully at all in this initial version, but this will be
remedied soon.

<!-- @} -->

<h2>Issues</h2>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>This specification is mostly feature-complete.  It's more or less fully
implemented in JavaScript, and has been tested on a fairly significant amount
of artificial input.  It has not been tested on real-world sites that use
execCommand(), and has not been thoroughly reviewed by anyone other than me.
It should be considered mostly stable and awaiting implementater review and
feedback.

<p>Significant known issues that I need feedback on, or otherwise am not
planning to fix just yet:

<ul>
  <li>Need to make CSS terminology more precise, about setting/unsetting CSS
  properties.  The intent is to modify the style attribute, CSSOM-style.
  Suggestions appreciated on how I should spec this.

  <li>I use [[resval]] instead of computed or used or anything like that, just
  because that's what my test implementation uses (via getComputedStyle).  This
  is not necessarily the best actual choice: if it should be something else,
  please tell me.

  <li><p>I haven't paid much attention to performance.  The algorithms here
  aren't performance-critical in most cases, but I might have accidentally
  included some algorithms that are too slow anyway on large pages.  Generally
  I haven't worried about throwing nodes away and recreating them multiple
  times or things like that, as long as it produces the correct result.

  <p>If it would be useful to implementers for me to spend time and spec
  complexity on avoiding some of the masses of useless operations that are
  currently required, please say so.  All intermediate DOM states are
  black-box detectable via mutation events or whatever their replacement will
  be, so implementers theoretically can't optimize most of this stuff too much
  themselves, but in practice I doubt anyone will rely on the intermediate DOM
  states much.

  <li>[[br]]s are a nightmare.  I have tons of hacks all over the place which
  are totally wrong, mostly to account for the fact that sometimes [[br]]s do
  nothing and we need to treat that case magically.  I don't know what a good
  way is to fix this.  At this point I've mostly gotten the evil concentrated
  in the definitions "collapsed line break", "extraneous line break", and
  "collapsed block prop", but there's lots of other special-case handling
  scattered about.  Feedback appreciated.  How do browsers handle this?

  <li>The CSS styling flag is an issue.  Currently authors are forced to turn
  it entirely on or entirely off.  If it's on, it produces stuff like <code
  title>&lt;span style=font-weight:bold></code> instead of <code
  title>&lt;b></code>, while if it's off, it produces stuff like <code
  title>&lt;font color=red></code> instead of <code title>&lt;span
  style=color:red></code>.  The issue is that authors might want a mix, like
  making the markup as concise as possible while still conforming, and they
  can't do that.  Changing the flag on a per-command basis doesn't help because
  of things like the "restore the values" algorithm, which might create several
  different types of style at once and has to use the same styling flag for all
  of them.  This was discussed back in March in <a
  href=http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030714.html>this
  thread</a>, along with a number of other things, but at that time I hadn't
  written commands that change multiple styles at once, so it seemed feasible
  to ask authors to switch styleWithCSS on or off on a per-command basis.

  <li>I haven't defined the "undo" or "redo" commands yet.  They look very
  complicated to define precisely, and other people are working on them right
  now.
</ul>

<p class=XXX>A variety of other issues are also noted in the text, formatted
like this.  Feedback would be appreciated on all of them.

<div class=comments>
<p>TODO:

<ul>
  <li>Scour browser bug trackers to try spotting issues I haven't thought of.

  <li>The wording I use for DOM stuff is not maximally precise.  Really I want
  DOM Core to define nice concepts that I can xref, like "insert a node".  I
  don't want to have to explicitly refer to DOM methods like insertBefore()
  every time I want to move things.

  <li>JavaScript can modify the DOM synchronously in some cases, such as DOM
  mutation events and onunload when moving around iframes and objects.  This
  has to be dealt with somehow.  (Pointed out by Ryosuke Niwa of WebKit:
  <a href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030730.html>1</a>
  <a href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-March/030751.html>2</a>)

  <li>What happens if you do something like delete a selection or insert text or
  whatnot in the middle of a surrogate pair?  This could make the content not
  serialize through a character encoding change.

  <li>Probably need to record and restore overrides in some more places.

  <li>Some more thought needs to go into what happens to the selection when you
  mutate the DOM.  In some cases the results are pretty arbitrary.  It might
  make sense to do some kind of normalization.

  <li>I'm sloppy about handling things like nodes that don't descend from a
  Document, comments that are children of a Document, that sort of thing.  Not
  essential for prototyping, but needs to be cleaned up eventually.  Mostly we
  should be able to avoid the problems by requiring that everything be
  editable, since that immediately means it has to descend from an element or
  Document (and cannot be parentless itself).

  <li>I need to pay more attention to invisible nodes.  These will have no visual
  effect, but they'll make many algorithms behave differently: decomposing a
  range, block-extending, etc.  Also, need to improve the definition to include
  things like whitespace-only nodes.

  <li>Have to make sure that in all the places where we set a selection, it's
  valid.

  <li>Redefine things in terms of ranges, not selections.

  <li>Allow some type of switch to affect non-editable regions too, perhaps on a
  per-command basis.

  <li>Things like delete, forwardDelete, insertText need to handle non-BMP
  characters.
</ul>

<p>Also TODO: Things that are only implemented by a couple of browsers and may
or may not be useful to spec:

<ul>
  <li>decreaseFontSize, increaseFontSize: Only implemented in Gecko and Opera.

  <li>contentReadOnly, enableInlineTableEditing, enableObjectResizing, heading,
  insertBrOnReturn: MDC docs say not implemented in IE (didn't test).

  <li>readOnly: MDC docs say it's a deprecated equivalent of contentReadOnly,
  so presumably like useCSS but less popular.

  <li>2D-Position, absolutePosition, clearAuthenticationCache, createBookmark,
  insertButton, insertFieldset, insertIframe, insertInput*, insertMarquee,
  insertSelectDropdown, insertSelectListbox, insertTextarea, liveResize,
  multipleSelection, overwrite, print, refresh, saveAs, unbookmark: Mentioned
  in MSDN docs but not MDC, so presumably IE-only.  Some of these seem
  inappropriate or useless, others will bear investigation.

  <li>findString, fontSizeDelta, insertNewlineInQuotedContent, justifyNone,
  print, transpose: There's code for these in WebKit,
  Source/WebCore/editing/EditorCommand.cpp, but I didn't see them mentioned
  elsewhere.  Some might be worth adding.

  <li>unselect: Seems to not be implemented by Gecko or Opera, and IE behaves
  oddly: it seems to collapse the selection instead of removing it.  Will only
  implement if there seems to be demand; it's redundant to
  Selection.removeAllRanges() anyway.
</ul>

<p>Things I haven't looked at that multiple browsers implement:

<ul>
  <li>redo, undo: Needs review of the Google work on this; will probably be
  quite complicated.
</ul>

<p>Also need to look at contenteditable=plaintext-only.
</div>

<p>Things that would be useful to address for the future but aren't important
to fix right now are in comments prefixed with "TODO".

<h2>Selections</h2>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=comments>
<p>IE9 and Firefox 6.0a2 allow arbitrary ranges in the selection, which follows
what this spec originally said.  However, this leads to unpleasant corner cases
that authors, implementers, and spec writers all have to deal with, and they
don't make any real sense.  Chrome 14 dev and Opera 11.11 aggressively
normalize selections, like not letting them lie inside empty elements and
things like that, but this is also viewed as a bad idea, because it takes
flexibility away from authors.

<p>So I changed the spec to a made-up compromise
that allows some simplification but doesn't constrain authors much.  See
<a href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-June/032072.html>discussion</a>.
Basically it would throw exceptions in some places to try to stop the selection
from containing a range that had a boundary point other than an Element or Text
node, or a boundary point that didn't descend from a Document.

<p>But this meant getRangeAt() had to start returning a copy, not a reference.
Also, it would be prone to things failing weirdly in corner cases.  Perhaps
most significantly, all sorts of problems might arise when DOM mutations
transpire, like if a boundary point's node is removed from its parent and the
mutation rules would place the new boundary point inside a non-Text/Element
node.  And finally, the previously-specified behavior had the advantage of
matching two major implementations, while the new behavior matched no one.  So
I changed it back.
</div>

<p>Every [[browsingcontext]] has a <dfn
title=concept-selection>selection</dfn>.  Each [[selection]] is associated with
a single [[range]], which may be null and is initially null. The user agent
should allow the user to change the [[selection]].  This one [[selection]] must
be shared by all the content of the [[browsingcontext]] (though not by nested
[[browsingcontexts]]), including any editing hosts in the document. Editing
hosts that are not inside a document cannot have a [[selection]].

<p class=comments>This paragraph is vague.  It needs to be replaced by detailed
conformance requirements saying exactly what to do for particular keystrokes,
like we have for backspace/delete/etc.

<p>If the [[selection]]'s [[range]] is not null and is [[rangecollapsed]], then
the caret position must be at that [[range]]'s [[boundarypoint]].  When the
[[selection]] is not empty, this specification does not define the caret
position; user agents should follow platform conventions in deciding whether
the caret is at the start of the [[selection]], the end of the [[selection]],
or somewhere else.

<p class=comments>This short-changes Mac users.  See <a
href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13909>bug 13909</a>.

<p>Each [[selection]] has a <dfn title=concept-selection-dir>direction</dfn>,
either <i title>forwards</i> or <i title>backwards</i>. If the user creates a
[[selection]] by indicating first one [[boundarypoint]] of the [[range]] and
then the other (such as by clicking on one point and dragging to another), and
the first indicated [[boundarypoint]] is [[bpafter]] the second, then the
corresponding [[selection]] must initially be backwards. Otherwise, it must be
forwards (including if the user didn't create the [[selection]], created it by
selecting an entire part of the page using a keyboard shortcut, etc.).

<p>[[Selections]] also have an <dfn>anchor</dfn> and a <dfn>focus</dfn>.  If
the [[selection]]'s [[range]] is null, its <span>anchor</span> and
<span>focus</span> are both null.  If the [[selection]]'s [[range]] is not null
and its [[seldir]] is forwards, its <span>anchor</span> is the [[range]]'s
[[rangestart]], and its <span>focus</span> is the [[rangeend]].  Otherwise, its
<span>focus</span> is the [[rangestart]] and its <span>anchor</span> is the
[[rangeend]].

<p class=comments>See also <a
href=http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/content/base/public/nsISelection.idl>nsISelection.idl</a>
from Gecko.  This spec doesn't have everything from there yet, in particular
selectionLanguageChange() and containsNode() are missing. They are missing
because I couldn't work out how to define them in terms of Ranges.

<p>The <code>Selection</code> interface represents a [[selection]].

<div class=note>
<p>Originally, the Selection interface was a Netscape feature.  The
original implementation was carried on into Gecko (Firefox), and the feature
was later implemented independently by other browser engines.  The Netscape
implementation always allowed multiple ranges in a single selection, for
instance so the user could select a column of a table.  However, multi-range
selections proved to be an unpleasant corner case that web developers didn't
know about and even Gecko developers rarely handled correctly.  Other browser
engines never implemented the feature, and clamped selections to a single range
in various incompatible fashions.

<p>This specification follows non-Gecko engines in restricting selections to at
most one range, but the API was still originally designed for selections with
arbitrary numbers of ranges.  This explains oddities like the coexistence of
{{code|removeRange()}} and {{code|removeAllRanges()}}, and a
{{code|getRangeAt()}} method that takes an integer argument that must always be
zero.
</div>

<p>All of the members of the <code>Selection</code> interface are defined in
terms of operations on the [[range]] object (if any) represented by the object.
These operations can raise exceptions, as defined for the [[range]] interface;
this can therefore result in the members of the <code>Selection</code>
interface raising exceptions as well, in addition to any explicitly called out
below.

<dl class=domintro>
  <dt><var>selection</var> . <code title=dom-Selection-anchorNode>anchorNode</code>

</dl>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-anchorNode><code>anchorNode</code></dfn>
attribute must return the [[contextobject]]'s <span>anchor</span>'s [[node]],
or null if the <span>anchor</span> is null.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-anchorOffset><code>anchorOffset</code></dfn>
attribute must return the [[contextobject]]'s <span>anchor</span>'s
[[bpoffset]], or 0 if the <span>anchor</span> is null.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-focusNode><code>focusNode</code></dfn>
attribute must return the [[contextobject]]'s <span>focus</span>'s [[node]], or
null if the <span>focus</span> is null.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-focusOffset><code>focusOffset</code></dfn>

    Otherwise, returns false.

  <dt><var>selection</var> . <code title=dom-Selection-collapse>collapse</code>(<var>parentNode</var>, <var>offset</var>)
  <dd>
    <p>Replaces the selection with a collapsed one at the given position.

  <dd>
    <p>Changes the <span>focus</span> while leaving the <span>anchor</span> in

  <dt><var>selection</var> . <code title=dom-Selection-modify>modify</code>(<var>alter</var>, <var>direction</var>, <var>granularity</var>)

    <p>If <var>alter</var> is "extend", changes the selection's focus in the

    right-to-left text).  <var>granularity</var> can be "character", "word",
    "sentence", "line", "paragraph", "lineboundary", "sentenceboundary",
    "paragraphboundary", or "documentboundary".

    <p>If <var>alter</var> is "move", then the anchor is also moved to the same
    position, so that the selection is empty.

    <p>Throws [[SyntaxError]] if one of the arguments is invalid.
</dl>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-isCollapsed><code>isCollapsed</code></dfn>
attribute must return true if the <span>anchor</span> and <span>focus</span>
are the same (including if both are null).  Otherwise it must return false.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-collapse><code>collapse(<var>parentNode</var>,
<var>offset</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>If <var>offset</var> is greater than the [[length]] of
  <var>parentNode</var>, [[throw]] an [[IndexSizeError]] exception and abort
  these steps.

  <li>Set the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] to a new [[range]] object with
  [[rangestart]] and [[rangeend]] both equal to (<var>parentNode</var>,
  <var>offset</var>).
</ol>

<p class=comments>For collapseToStart/End, IE9 mutates the existing range,
while Firefox 9.0a2 and Chrome 15 dev replace it with a new one.  The spec
follows the majority and replaces it with a new one, leaving the old Range
object unchanged.

<p>The <dfn
title=dom-Selection-collapseToStart><code>collapseToStart()</code></dfn> method
must [[throw]] an [[InvalidStateError]] exception if the [[contextobject]]'s
[[range]] is null.  Otherwise, it must set the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] to
a new [[range]] object with [[rangestart]] and [[rangeend]] both equal to the
[[contextobject]]'s old [[range]]'s [[rangestart]].

<p>The <dfn
title=dom-Selection-collapseToEnd><code>collapseToEnd()</code></dfn> method
must [[throw]] an [[InvalidStateError]] exception if the [[contextobject]]'s
[[range]] is null.  Otherwise, it must set the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] to
a new [[range]] object with [[rangestart]] and [[rangeend]] both equal to the
[[contextobject]]'s old [[range]]'s [[rangeend]].

<p class=comments>Reverse-engineered circa January 2011.  IE doesn't support it, so I'm
relying on Firefox (implemented extend() sometime before 2000) and WebKit
(implemented extend() in 2007).  I'm mostly ignoring Opera, because gsnedders
tells me its implementation isn't compatible.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-extend><code>extend(<var>parentNode</var>,
<var>offset</var>)</code></dfn> method must run these steps:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments>Gecko raises a nonstandard exception, WebKit initializes to
  a zero-length selection at the given point, Opera silently ignores it.
  Gecko's behavior of throwing wins, but with a standardized exception type.

  <p>If the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] is null, [[throw]] an
  [[InvalidStateError]] exception and abort these steps.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Gecko and WebKit agree on this, Opera ignores the call.

  <p>If <var>offset</var> is greater than <var>parentNode</var>'s [[length]],
  [[throw]] an [[IndexSizeError]] exception and abort these steps.

  <li>Let <var>range</var> be the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]].

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Gecko does this.  I can't work out what WebKit does, but it
  seems weird.  Why backwards?  I don't know, it's what Gecko seems to do.
  (Direction in WebKit does not appear to be black-box detectable in this
  case.)

  <p>If <var>parentNode</var>'s [[root]] is not the same as <var>range</var>'s
  [[rangeroot]], set <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] and [[rangeend]] to
  (<var>parentNode</var>, <var>offset</var>), set the [[contextobject]]'s
  [[seldir]] to backwards, and abort these steps.

  <li>Let <var>anchor</var> and <var>focus</var> be the [[contextobject]]'s
  <span>anchor</span> and <span>focus</span>, and let <var>newFocus</var> be
  the [[boundarypoint]] given by <var>parentNode</var> and <var>offset</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Gecko actually seems to set the direction to forwards if
  the selection was collapsed.  But this doesn't make any sense, since it
  doesn't appear to change the direction otherwise, so I'm just going to call
  it a bug.  (WebKit's direction here does not seem to be black-box
  detectable.)

  <p>If <var>focus</var> and <var>newFocus</var> are the same, abort these
  steps.

  <li>Set <var>range</var>'s [[rangestart]] to <var>anchor</var> and its
  [[rangeend]] to <var>newFocus</var>, if <var>anchor</var> is [[bpbefore]] or
  equal to <var>newFocus</var>; or vice versa, if it's [[bpafter]].

  <li>If <var>newFocus</var> is [[bpbefore]] <var>anchor</var>, set the
  [[contextobject]]'s [[seldir]] to backwards.  Otherwise, set it to forwards.
</ol>

<p class=comments>Reverse-engineered from WebKit circa January-February 2011.
They were the ones who introduced it, and so far only Gecko has copied them in
Firefox 4, which isn't even a final release yet, so presumably WebKit is the
one to track.  Still, it probably isn't so widely used yet, so I follow Gecko
when it makes more sense.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-modify><code>modify(<var>alter</var>,
<var>direction</var>, <var>granularity</var>)</code></dfn> method must run
these steps:

<p class=XXX>Does not match reality at all.  Needs precise definition and
tests.

<ol>
  <li>If the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] is null, abort these steps.

  <li>Convert <var>alter</var>, <var>direction</var>, and
  <var>granularity</var> <span title="converted to ASCII lowercase"
  data-anolis-spec=html>to ASCII lowercase</span>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>WebKit silently aborts if the arguments aren't recognized,
  but Gecko throws.  Following Gecko for consistency for the other APIs here.

  <p>If <var>alter</var> does not equal either "extend" or "move", [[throw]] a
  [[SyntaxError]] exception and abort these steps.

  <li>If <var>direction</var> does not equal one of "forward", "backward",
  "left", or "right", [[throw]] a [[SyntaxError]] exception and abort these
  steps.

  <li>If <var>granularity</var> does not equal one of "character", "word",
  "sentence", "line", "paragraph", "lineboundary", "sentenceboundary",
  "paragraphboundary", or "documentboundary", [[throw]] a [[SyntaxError]]
  exception and abort these steps.

  <li>Let <var>anchor</var> and <var>focus</var> be the [[contextobject]]'s
  <span>anchor</span> and <span>focus</span>.

  <li>If <var>direction</var> is "forward", or if it's "right" and the
  [[directionality]] of <var>focus</var>' [[node]] is "ltr", or if it's "left"
  and the [[directionality]] of <var>focus</var>' [[node]] is "rtl", let
  <var>logical direction</var> be "forward".  Otherwise, let it be "backward".

  <li>Let <var>target</var> be the [[boundarypoint]] obtained by the following
  subalgorithm:

<p>Based mostly on Firefox 9.0a2.  It has a bug that I didn't reproduce, namely
that if you pass a Document as the argument, the end offset becomes 1 instead
of the number of children it has.  It also throws a RangeException instead of
DOMException, because its implementation predated their merging.

<p>IE9 behaves similarly but with glitches.  It throws "Unspecified error." if
the node is detached or display:none, and apparently in some random other cases
too.  It throws "Invalid argument." for detached comments (only!).  Finally, if
you pass it a comment, it seems to select the whole comment, unlike with text
nodes.

<p>Chrome 16 dev behaves as you'd expect given its Selection implementation.
It refuses to select anything that's not visible, so it's almost always wrong.
Opera 11.50 just does nothing in all my tests, as usual.

<p class=comments>IE9 and Firefox 4.0 return the same object every time, as the
spec says.  Chrome 12 dev and Opera 11.10 return a different object every time.

<p>The <dfn
title=dom-Selection-getRangeAt><code>getRangeAt(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn>
method must [[throw]] an [[IndexSizeError]] exception if <var>index</var> is not
0, or if the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] is null.  Otherwise, it must return
a reference to (not a copy of) the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]]. (Thus
subsequent calls must return the same object if nothing has removed the
[[contextobject]]'s [[range]] in the meantime.)

<div class=comments>
<p>IE9 and Firefox 4.0 store a reference, as described here.  Chrome 12 dev and
Opera 11.10 appear to store a copy, so changes don't affect the selection.

<p>Chrome 15 dev seems to ignore addRange() if there's already a range.  IE9
replaces the existing range.  Firefox 9.0a2, of course, just gives you a
multi-range selection.  IE is likely to behave closest to Firefox, and is also
more useful than silent failure, so the spec goes with that.
</div>

<p>The <dfn
title=dom-Selection-addRange><code>addRange(<var>range</var>)</code></dfn>
method must set the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] to a reference to (not a copy
of) <var>range</var>. Since <var>range</var> is added by reference, subsequent
calls to <code title=dom-Selection-getRangeAt>getRangeAt(0)</code> must return
the same object, and any changes that a script makes to <var>range</var> after
it is added must be reflected in the [[selection]], until something else
removes or replaces the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]].

<p>The <dfn
title=dom-Selection-removeRange><code>removeRange(<var>range</var>)</code></dfn>
method must set the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] to null if its [[range]] is
currently <var>range</var>, otherwise do nothing.

<p class=XXX>Do we check for object equality here or just equality of boundary
points?

<p>The <dfn
title=dom-Selection-removeAllRanges><code>removeAllRanges()</code></dfn> method
must set the [[contextobject]]'s [[range]] to null and its [[seldir]] to
forwards.

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Selection-stringifier>stringifier</dfn> must . . .

<p class=XXX>Complicated.  The Selection stringifier is magical like innerText.
See <a href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=10583>W3C bug

<p>This specification extends several interfaces to provide entry points to the
interfaces defined in this specification.

<dl class=domintro>
  <dt><var>window</var> . <code title=dom-Window-getSelection>getSelection</code>()
  <dt><var>document</var> . <code title=dom-Document-getSelection>getSelection</code>()
  <dd>
    <p>Returns the <code>Selection</code> object for the window, which
    stringifies to the text of the current selection.
</dl>

<pre class=idl>partial interface <span data-anolis-spec=dom>Document</span> {
  <span>Selection</span> <span title=dom-Document-getSelection>getSelection</span>();
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Document-getSelection><code>getSelection()</code></dfn>
method on the [[document]] interface must return the same
<code>Selection</code> object as its <code data-anolis-spec=html
title=dom-Document-defaultView>defaultView</code>'s <code
title=dom-Window-getSelection>getSelection()</code> method.

<pre class=idl>partial interface <span data-anolis-spec=html>Window</span> {
  <span>Selection</span> <span title=dom-Window-getSelection>getSelection</span>();
};</pre>

<p>The <dfn title=dom-Window-getSelection><code>getSelection()</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>Window</code> interface must return
the <code>Selection</code> object representing the [[selection]] of that <code
data-anolis-spec=html>Window</code> object's <span
data-anolis-spec=html>browsing context</span>.

<h2>Commands</h2>

<h3>Properties of commands</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>This specification defines a number of <dfn title=command>commands</dfn>,
identified by <span data-anolis-spec=domcore>ASCII case-insensitive</span>
strings.  Each <span>command</span> can have several pieces of data associated
with it:

<ul>
  <li><dfn>Action</dfn>: What the <span>command</span> does when executed via
  <code>execCommand()</code>.  Every <span>command</span> defined in this
  specification has an <span>action</span> defined for it in the relevant
  section.  For example, <span>the <code title>bold</code> command</span>'s
  <span>action</span> generally makes the current selection bold, or removes
  bold if the selection is already bold.  An editing toolbar might provide
  buttons that execute the <span>action</span> for a <span>command</span> if
  clicked, or a script might run an <span>action</span> without user
  interaction to achieve some particular effect.

  <li><dfn>Indeterminate</dfn>: A boolean value returned by
  <code>queryCommandIndeterm()</code>, depending on the current state of the
  document.  Generally, a <span>command</span> that has a <span>state</span>
  defined will be <span>indeterminate</span> if the <span>state</span> is true
  for part but not all of the current selection, and a <span>command</span>
  that has a <span>value</span> defined will be <span>indeterminate</span> if
  different parts of the selection have different <span
  title=value>values</span>.  An editing toolbar might display a button or
  control in a special way if the <span>command</span> is
  <span>indeterminate</span>, like showing a "bold" button as partially
  depressed, or leaving a font size selector blank instead of showing the font
  size of the current selection.  As a rule, a <span>command</span> can only be
  <span>indeterminate</span> if its <span>state</span> is false, supposing it
  has a <span>state</span>.

  <li><dfn>State</dfn>: A boolean value returned by
  <code>queryCommandState()</code>, depending on the current state of the
  document.  The <span>state</span> of a <span>command</span> is true if it is
  already in effect, in some sense specific to the <span>command</span>.  Most
  <span title=command>commands</span> that have a <span>state</span> defined
  will take opposite <span title=action>actions</span> depending on whether the
  <span>state</span> is true or false, such as making the selection bold if the
  <span>state</span> is false and removing bold if the <span>state</span> is
  true.  Others will just have no effect if the <span>state</span> is true,
  like <span>the <code title>justifyCenter</code> command</span>.  Still others
  will have the same effect regardless, like <span>the <code
  title>styleWithCss</code> command</span>.  An editing toolbar might display a
  button or control differently depending on the <span>state</span> and <span
  title=indeterminate>indeterminacy</span> of the <span>command</span>.

  <li><dfn>Value</dfn>: A string returned by <code>queryCommandValue()</code>,
  depending on the current state of the document.  A <span>command</span>
  usually has a <span>value</span> instead of a <span>state</span> if the
  property it modifies can take more than two different values, like <span>the
  <code title>foreColor</code> command</span>.  If the <span>command</span> is
  <span>indeterminate</span>, its <span>value</span> is generally based on the
  start of the selection.  Otherwise, in most cases the <span>value</span>
  holds true for the entire selection, but see <span>the <code
  title>justifyCenter</code> command</span> and <span title="the justifyFull
  command">its</span> <span title="the justifyLeft command">three</span> <span
  title="the justifyRight command">companions</span> for an exception.  An
  editing toolbar might display the <span>value</span> of a
  <span>command</span> as selected in a drop-down or filled in in a text box,
  if the <span>command</span> isn't <span>indeterminate</span>.

  <li><dfn>Relevant CSS property</dfn>: This is defined for certain <a
  href=#inline-formatting-commands>inline formatting commands</a>, and is used
  in algorithms specific to those commands.  It is an implementation detail,
  and is not exposed to authors.  If a <span>command</span> does not have a
  <span>relevant CSS property</span> specified, it defaults to null.
</ul>

<!-- @} -->
<h3 id=supported-commands>Supported commands</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=comments>If you try doing anything with an unrecognized command, IE9
throws an "Invalid argument" exception, and Firefox 6.0a2 throws
NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.  Chrome 14 dev and Opera 11.11 both just return a
useless value.  I go with IE/Gecko, although of course with a standard
exception type.

<p>Some <span title=command>commands</span> will be <dfn>supported</dfn> in a
given user agent, and some will not.  All <span title=command>commands</span>
defined in this specification must be <span>supported</span>, except optionally
<span>the <code title>copy</code> command</span>, <span>the <code
title>cut</code> command</span>, and/or <span>the <code title>paste</code>
command</span>.  Additional <span title=command>commands</span> can also be
<span>supported</span>, but implementers should prefix any nonstandard
<span>command</span> names with a vendor-specific string (e.g., "ms", "moz",
"webkit", "opera").

<p class=comments>I.e., no trying to look good on lazy conformance tests by
just sticking in a stub implementation that does nothing.

<p>A <span>command</span> that does absolutely nothing in a particular user
agent, such that <code>execCommand()</code> never has any effect and
<code>queryCommandEnabled()</code> and <code>queryCommandIndeterm()</code> and
<code>queryCommandState()</code> and <code>queryCommandValue()</code> each
return the same value all the time, must not be <span>supported</span>.


<p>In a particular user agent, every <span>command</span> must be consistently
either <span>supported</span> or not.  Specifically, a user agent must not
permit one page to see the same <span>command</span> sometimes
<span>supported</span> and sometimes not over the course of the same browsing
session, unless the user agent has been upgraded or reconfigured in the middle
of a session.  However, user agents may treat the same <span>command</span> as
<span>supported</span> for some pages and not others, e.g., if the
<span>command</span> is only supported for certain origins for security
reasons.

<p>Authors can tell whether a <span>command</span> is <span>supported</span>
using <code>queryCommandSupported()</code>.

<!-- @} -->
<h3>Enabled commands</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>At any given time, a <span>supported</span> command can be either
<dfn>enabled</dfn> or not.  Authors can tell whether a <span>command</span> is
currently <span>enabled</span> using <code>queryCommandEnabled()</code>.  <span
title=command>Commands</span> that are not <span>enabled</span> do nothing, as
described in the definitions of the various methods that invoke <span
title=command>commands</span>.

<div class=comments>
<p>Testing with bold:

<p>IE10PP2 seems to return true if the active range's start node is editable,
false otherwise.

<p>Firefox 6.0a2 seems to always return true if there's anything editable on the
page, and throw otherwise.  (This is <a
href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676401>bug 676401</a>.)

<p>Chrome 14 dev seems to behave the same as IE10PP2.

<p>Opera 11.11 seems to always return true if there's anything editable on the
page, and false otherwise.

<p>Firefox and Opera behave more or less uselessly.  IE doesn't make much sense,
in that whether a command is enabled seems meaningless: it will execute it on
all nodes in the selection, editable or not.  Chrome's definition makes sense
in that it will only run the command if it's enabled, but it doesn't make much
sense to only have the command run if the start is editable.

<p>It's not clear to me what the point of this method is.  There's no way we're
going to always return true if the command will do something and false if it
won't.  I just stuck with a really conservative definition that happens to be
convenient: if there's nothing selected, obviously nothing will work, and we
want to bail out early in that case anyway because all the algorithms will talk
about the active range.  If there are use-cases for it to be more precise, I
could make it so.
</div>

<p>Among <span title=command>commands</span> defined in this specification,
those listed in <a href=#miscellaneous-commands>Miscellaneous commands</a> are
always <span>enabled</span>.  The other <span title=command>commands</span>
defined here are <span>enabled</span> if the <span>active range</span> is not
null, and disabled otherwise.

<p class=comments>TODO: Define behavior for <var>show UI</var>.

<p>When the <dfn title=execCommand()><code>execCommand(<var>command</var>,
<var>show UI</var>, <var>value</var>)</code></dfn> method on the <code
data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface is invoked, the user agent
must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>If only one argument was provided, let <var>show UI</var> be false.

  <li>If only one or two arguments were provided, let <var>value</var> be the
  empty string.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>See comment before <a href=#supported-commands>Supported
  commands</a>.

  <p>If <var>command</var> is not <span>supported</span>, [[throw]] a
  [[NotSupportedError]] exception.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>I didn't research this closely, but at a first glance, this
  is possibly how Chrome 14 dev and Opera 11.11 behave.  Maybe also Firefox
  6.0a2, except it throws if the command isn't enabled, I think.  IE9 returns
  true in at least some cases even if the command is disabled.  TODO: Is this
  right?  Maybe we should be returning false in other cases too?

  <p>If <var>command</var> is not <span>enabled</span>, return false.

  <li>Take the <span>action</span> for <var>command</var>, passing
  <var>value</var> to the instructions as an argument.

  <li>Return true.
</ol>

<p>When the <dfn
title=queryCommandEnabled()><code>queryCommandEnabled(<var>command</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments>See comment before <a href=#supported-commands>Supported
  commands</a>.

  <p>If <var>command</var> is not <span>supported</span>, [[throw]] a
  [[NotSupportedError]] exception.

  <li>Return true if <var>command</var> is <span>enabled</span>, false
  otherwise.
</ol>

<p>When the <dfn
title=queryCommandIndeterm()><code>queryCommandIndeterm(<var>command</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments>See comment before <a href=#supported-commands>Supported
  commands</a>.

  <p>If <var>command</var> is not <span>supported</span>, [[throw]] a
  [[NotSupportedError]] exception.

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>What happens if you call queryCommand(Indeterm|State|Value)() on a command
  where it makes no sense?

  <p>IE9 consistently returns false for all three.  However, any command that
  has a state defined also has a value defined, which is equal to the state: it
  returns boolean true or false.

  <p>Firefox 6.0a2 consistently throws NS_ERROR_FAILURE for indeterm/state if
  not supported, and returns an empty string for value.  Exceptions include
  unlink (seems to always return indeterm/state false), and styleWithCss/useCss
  (throw NS_ERROR_FAILURE even for value).

  <p>Chrome 14 dev returns false for all three, and even does this for
  unrecognized commands.  It also always defines value if state is defined: it
  returns the state cast to a string, either "true" or "false".

  <p>Opera 11.11 returns false for state and "" for value (it doesn't support
  indeterm).  Like Chrome, this is even for unrecognized commands.

  <p>Gecko's behavior is the most useful.  If the author tries querying some
  aspect of a command that makes no sense, they shouldn't receive a value that
  looks like it might make sense but is actually just a constant.  Originally,
  I went even further than Gecko: I required exceptions even for value, since
  doing otherwise makes no sense.  But throwing more exceptions is less
  compatible on the whole than throwing more exceptions, so based on <a
  href=http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-September/033235.html>discussion</a>,
  I switched to a behavior more like Opera, which is more or less IE/WebKit
  behavior but made slightly more sane.
  </div>

  <p>If <var>command</var> has no <span
  title=indeterminate>indeterminacy</span> or is not <span>enabled</span>,
  return false.

  <li>Return true if <var>command</var> is <span>indeterminate</span>,
  otherwise false.
</ol>

<p>When the <dfn
title=queryCommandState()><code>queryCommandState(<var>command</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments>See comment before <a href=#supported-commands>Supported
  commands</a>.

  <p>If <var>command</var> is not <span>supported</span>, [[throw]] a
  [[NotSupportedError]] exception.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>See comment on the comparable line for
  <span>queryCommandIndeterm()</span>.

  <p>If <var>command</var> has no <span>state</span> or is not

  <li>If the <span>state override</span> for <var>command</var> is set, return
  it.

  <li>Return true if <var>command</var>'s <span>state</span> is true, otherwise
  false.
</ol>

<p class=comments>Firefox 6.0a2 always throws an exception when this is
called.  Opera 11.11 seems to return false if there's nothing editable on the
page, which is unhelpful.  The spec follows IE9 and Chrome 14 dev.  The reason
this is useful, compared to just running one of the other methods and seeing if
you get a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, is that other methods might throw different
exceptions for other reasons.  It's easier to check a boolean than to check
exception types, especially since as of June 2011 UAs aren't remotely
consistent on what they do with unsupported commands.

<p>When the <dfn
title=queryCommandSupported()><code>queryCommandSupported(<var>command</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
invoked, the user agent must return true if <var>command</var> is
<span>supported</span>, and false otherwise.

<p>When the <dfn
title=queryCommandValue()><code>queryCommandValue(<var>command</var>)</code></dfn>
method on the <code data-anolis-spec=html>HTMLDocument</code> interface is
invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments>See comment before <a href=#supported-commands>Supported

  <p>If <var>command</var> is not <span>supported</span>, [[throw]] a
  [[NotSupportedError]] exception.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>This is what Firefox 6.0a2 and Opera 11.11 seem to do when
  the command isn't enabled.  Chrome 14 dev seems to return the string "false",
  and IE9 seems to return boolean false.  For the case where there's no value,
  see the comment on the comparable line for
  <span>queryCommandIndeterm()</span>.

  <p>If <var>command</var> has no <span>value</span> or is not
  <span>enabled</span>, return the empty string.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Yuck.  This is incredibly messy, as are lots of other
  fontSize-related things, but I don't want to define a whole second notion of
  value for the sake of a single command . . .

  <p>If <var>command</var> is "fontSize" and its <span>value override</span>
  is set, convert the <span>value override</span> to an integer number of
  pixels and return the <span>legacy font size for</span> the result.

  <li>If the <span>value override</span> for <var>command</var> is set, return
  it.

  <li>Return <var>command</var>'s <span>value</span>.
</ol>

<p>All of these methods must treat their <var>command</var> argument <span
data-anolis-spec=domcore title="ASCII case-insensitive">ASCII
case-insensitively</span>.

<div class=note>
<p>The methods in this section have mostly been designed so that the following
invariants hold after <code title>execCommand()</code> is called, assuming it
didn't throw an exception:

<ul>
  <li><code title>queryCommandIndeterm()</code> will return false (or throw an
  exception).

  <li><code title>queryCommandState()</code> will return the opposite of what it did
  before <code title>execCommand()</code> was called (or throw an exception).

  <li><code title>queryCommandValue()</code> will return something equivalent to the
  value passed to <code title>execCommand()</code> (or throw an exception).
  "Equivalent" here needs to be construed broadly in some cases, such as
  <code title>fontSize</code>.
</ul>

<p>The first two points do not always hold for <code title>strikethrough</code>
or <code title>underline</code>, because it can be impossible to unset
text-decoration in CSS.  Also, by design, the state of <code
title>insertOrderedList</code> and <code title>insertUnorderedList</code> might
be true both before and after calling, because they only remove one level of
indentation.  <code title>unlink</code> should set the value to null.  And
finally, the state of the various <code title>justify</code> commands should
always be true after calling, and the value should always be the appropriate
string ("center", "justify", "left", or "right").  Any other deviations from
these invariants are bugs in the specification.

<h2>Common definitions</h2>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>An <dfn>HTML element</dfn> is an [[element]] whose [[namespace]] is the
[[htmlnamespace]].

<p>A <dfn>prohibited paragraph child name</dfn> is "address", "article",
"aside", "blockquote", "caption", "center", "col", "colgroup", "dd", "details",
"dir", "div", "dl", "dt", "fieldset", "figcaption", "figure", "footer", "form",
"h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "header", "hgroup", "hr", "li", "listing",
"menu", "nav", "ol", "p", "plaintext", "pre", "section", "summary", "table",
"tbody", "td", "tfoot", "th", "thead", "tr", "ul", or "xmp".

<p class=comments>These are all the things that will close a &lt;p> if found as
a descendant.  I think.  Plus table stuff, since that can't be a descendant of
a p either, although it won't auto-close it.

<p>A <dfn>prohibited paragraph child</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span>
whose [[localname]] is a <span>prohibited paragraph child name</span>.

<p class=comments>The block/inline node definitions are CSS-based.  "Prohibited
paragraph child" is conceptually similar to "block node", but based on the
element name.  Generally we want to use block/inline node when we're interested
in the visual effect, and prohibited paragraph children when we're concerned
about parsing or semantics.  TODO: Audit all "block node" usages to see if they
need to become "visible block node", now that block nodes can be invisible (if
they descend from display: none).

<p>A <dfn>block node</dfn> is either an [[element]] whose "display" property
does not have [[resval]] "inline" or "inline-block" or "inline-table" or
"none", or a [[document]], or a [[documentfragment]].

<p>An <dfn>inline node</dfn> is a [[node]] that is not a <span>block
node</span>.

<p>An <dfn>editing host</dfn> is a [[node]] that is either an <span>HTML
element</span> with a <code data-anolis-spec=html
title=attr-contenteditable>contenteditable</code> attribute set to the true
state, or the <span>HTML element</span> [[child]] of a [[document]] whose <code
data-anolis-spec=html>designMode</code> is enabled.

<p>Something is <dfn>editable</dfn> if it is a [[node]]; it is not an
<span>editing host</span>; it does not have a <code data-anolis-spec=html
title=attr-contenteditable>contenteditable</code> attribute set to the false
state; its [[parent]] is an <span>editing host</span> or <span>editable</span>;
and either it is an <span>HTML element</span>, or it is an [[svg]] or [[math]]
element, or it is not an [[element]] and its [[parent]] is an <span>HTML
element</span>.

<p class=note>An <span>editable</span> node cannot be a [[document]] or
[[documentfragment]], its [[parent]] cannot be null, and it must descend from
either an [[element]] or a [[document]].

<p>The <dfn>editing host of</dfn> <var>node</var> is null if <var>node</var> is
neither <span>editable</span> nor an <span>editing host</span>; <var>node</var>
itself, if <var>node</var> is an <span>editing host</span>; or the nearest
[[ancestor]] of <var>node</var> that is an <span>editing host</span>, if
<var>node</var> is <span>editable</span>.

<p>Two [[nodes]] are <dfn>in the same editing host</dfn> if the <span>editing
host of</span> the first is non-null and the same as the <span>editing host
of</span> the second.

<p class=note>Barring bugs, the algorithms here will not alter the attributes
of a non-editable element; will not remove a non-editable node from its parent
(except to immediately give it a new parent in the same editing host); and will
not add, remove, or reorder children of a node unless it is either editable or
an editing host.  An editing host is never editable, so authors are assured
that editing commands will only modify the editing host's contents and not the
editing host itself.

<p>A <dfn>collapsed line break</dfn> is a [[br]] that begins a line box which
has nothing else in it, and therefore has zero height.

<p class=XXX>Is this a good definition at all?  I mean things like
&lt;p>foo&lt;br>&lt;/p>, or the second one in &lt;p>foo&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p>.
The way I test it is by adding a text node after it containing a zwsp; if that
changes the offsetHeight of its nearest non-inline ancestor, I deem it
collapsed.  But what if it happens to be display: none right now, for instance?
Or its ancestor has a fixed height?  Would it be better to use some DOM-based
definition?

<p class=comments>TODO: The thing about li is a not very nice hack.  The issue
is that an li won't collapse even if it has no children at all, but that's not
true in all browsers (at least not in Opera 11.11), and also it breaks
assumptions elsewhere.  E.g., if it gets turned into a p.

<p>An <dfn>extraneous line break</dfn> is a [[br]] that has no visual effect,
in that removing it from the DOM would not change layout, except that a [[br]]
that is the sole child of an [[li]] is not extraneous.

<p class=XXX>Also possibly a bad definition.  Again, I test by just removing it
and seeing what happens.  (Actually, setting display: none, so that it doesn't
mess up ranges.)

<p>A <dfn>whitespace node</dfn> is either a [[text]] node whose [[cddata]] is

<p class=XXX>This definition is also bad.  It's a crude attempt to emulate
CSS2.1 16.6.1, but leaving out a ton of the subtleties.  I actually don't want
the exact CSS definitions, because those depend on things like where lines are
broken, but I'm not sure this definition is right anyway.  E.g., what about a
pre-line text node consisting of a single line break that's at the end of a
block?  That collapses, same idea as an extraneous line break.  We could also
worry about nodes containing only zwsp or such if we wanted, or display: none,
or . . .

<ol>
  <li>If <var>node</var> is not a <span>whitespace node</span>, return false.

  <li>If <var>node</var>'s [[cddata]] is the empty string, return true.

  <li>Let <var>ancestor</var> be <var>node</var>'s [[parent]].

  <li>If <var>ancestor</var> is null, return true.

  <li>If the "display" property of some [[ancestor]] of <var>node</var> has
  [[resval]] "none", return true.

  <li>While <var>ancestor</var> is not a <span>block node</span> and its
  [[parent]] is not null, set <var>ancestor</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>At this point we know <var>node</var> consists of some whitespace, of a
  sort that will collapse if it's at the start or end of a line.  We go
  backwards until we find the first block boundary, and if everything until
  there is invisible or whitespace, we conclude that <var>node</var> is
  collapsed.  We assume a block boundary is either when we hit a line break or
  block node, or we hit the end of <var>ancestor</var> (which is the nearest
  ancestor block node).  All this is very imprecise, of course, but it's fairly
  simple and will work in common cases.

  <p>We have to avoid invoking the definition of "visible" here to avoid
  infinite recursion: that depends on the concept of collapsed whitespace
  nodes.  Instead, we repeat the parts we need, which turns out to be "not
  much of it".

  the same line, so presumably it's not at the line's start.  Now we need to

<p class=comments>TODO: Consider whether we really want to depend on img
specifically here.  It seems more likely that we want something like "any
replaced content that has nonzero height and width" or such.  When fixing this,
make sure to audit for other occurrences of this assumption.

<p>Something is <dfn>visible</dfn> if it is a [[node]] that either is a
<span>block node</span>, or a [[text]] node that is not a <span>collapsed
whitespace node</span>, or an [[img]], or a [[br]] that is not an
<span>extraneous line break</span>, or any [[node]] with a <span>visible</span>
[[descendant]]; excluding any [[node]] with an [[inclusiveancestor]]
[[element]] whose "display" property has [[resval]] "none".

<p>Something is <dfn>invisible</dfn> if it is a [[node]] that is not
<span>visible</span>.

<p class=comments>TODO: Reconsider whether we want to lump invisible nodes in
here.  If we don't and change the definition, make sure to audit all callers,
since then a block could have collapsed block prop descendants that aren't
children.

<p>A <dfn>collapsed block prop</dfn> is either a <span>collapsed line
break</span> that is not an <span>extraneous line break</span>, or an
[[element]] that is an <span>inline node</span> and whose [[children]] are all
either <span>invisible</span> or <span title="collapsed block prop">collapsed
block props</span> and that has at least one [[child]] that is a
<span>collapsed block prop</span>.

<p class=note>A collapsed block prop is something like the <code
title>&lt;br></code> in <code title>&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;/p></code>, or the <code
title>&lt;br></code> and <code title>&lt;span></code> in <code
title>&lt;p>&lt;span>&lt;br>&lt;/span>&lt;/p></code>.  These are necessary to
stop the block from having zero height when it has no other contents, but serve
no purpose and should be removed once the block has other contents that stop it
from collapsing.

<p class=comments>TODO: I say "first range" because I think that's what Gecko
actually does, and Gecko is the only one that allows multiple ranges in a
selection.  This is keeping in mind that it stores ranges sorted by start, not
by the order the user added them, and silently removes or shortens existing
ranges to avoid overlap.  It probably makes the most sense in the long term to
have the command affect all ranges.  But I'll leave this for later.

<p>The <dfn>active range</dfn> is the [[range]] of the [[selection]] given by
calling [[getselection]] on the [[contextobject]].  (Thus the <span>active
range</span> may be null.)

<p>Each [[htmldocument]] has a boolean <dfn>CSS styling flag</dfn> associated
with it, which must initially be false.  (<span>The <code
title>styleWithCSS</code> command</span> can be used to modify or query it, by
means of the <code>execCommand()</code> and <code>queryCommandState()</code>
methods.)

<p>For some <span title=command>commands</span>, each [[htmldocument]] must
have a boolean <dfn>state override</dfn> and/or a string <dfn>value
override</dfn>.  These do not change the <span>command</span>'s
<span>state</span> or <span>value</span>, but change the way some algorithms
behave, as specified in those algorithms' definitions.  Initially, both must be
unset for every <span>command</span>.  Whenever the number of [[ranges]] in the
[[selection]] changes to something different, and whenever a [[boundarypoint]]
of the [[range]] at a given index in the [[selection]] changes to something
different, the <span>state override</span> and <span>value override</span> must
be unset for every <span>command</span>.  The <span>value override</span> for
<span>the <code title>backColor</code> command</span> must be the same as the
<span>value override</span> for <span>the <code title>hiliteColor</code>
command</span>, such that setting one sets the other to the same thing and
unsetting one unsets the other.

<p class=note>The primary purpose of state and value overrides is that if the
user runs a command like <a href=#the-bold-command><code title>bold</code></a>
with a collapsed selection, then types something without moving the cursor,
they expect it to have the given style (bold or such).  Thus the commands like
<a href=#the-bold-command><code title>bold</code></a> set state and value
overrides, and <a href=#the-inserttext-command><code
title>insertText</code></a> checks for them and applies them to the
newly-inserted text.  Other commands like <a href=#the-delete-command><code
title>delete</code></a> also interact with overrides.

<p class=XXX>Figure out exactly what commands need to preserve state/value
overrides.

<p>When this specification refers to a method or attribute that is defined in a
specification, the user agent must treat the method or attribute as defined by
that specification.  In particular, if a script has overridden a standard
property with a custom one, the user agent must only use the overridden
property when a script refers to it, and must continue to use the
specification-defined behavior when this specification refers to it.

<p>When a list or set of [[nodes]] is assigned to a variable without specifying
the order, they must be initially in [[treeorder]], if they share a root.
(If they don't share a root, the order will be specified.)  When the user agent
is instructed to run particular steps for each member of a list, it must do so
sequentially in the list's order.

<h2>Common algorithms</h2>

<h3>Assorted common algorithms</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>To move a [[node]] to a new location, <dfn>preserving ranges</dfn>, remove
the [[node]] from its original [[parent]] (if any), then insert it in the new
location.  In doing so, follow these rules instead of those defined by the
[[insert]] and [[remove]] algorithms:

<p class=note>Many of the algorithms in this specification move nodes around in
the DOM.  The normal rules for range mutation require that any range endpoints
inside those nodes are moved to the node's parent as soon as the node is moved,
which would corrupt the selection.  For instance, if the user selects the text
"foo" and then bolds it, first we produce <code
title>&lt;b>&lt;/b>foo</code>, then <code title>&lt;b>foo&lt;/b></code>.  When
we move the "foo" text node into its new parent, we have to do so "preserving
ranges", so that the text "foo" is still selected.

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>node</var> be the moved [[node]], <var>old parent</var> and
  <var>old index</var> be the old [[parent]] (which may be null) and [[index]],
  and <var>new parent</var> and <var>new index</var> be the new [[parent]] and
  [[index]].

  <li>
  <p class=comments>This is actually implicit, but I state it anyway for
  completeness.

  <p>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[node]] is the same as or a [[descendant]] of
  <var>node</var>, leave it unchanged, so it moves to the new location.

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[node]] is <var>new parent</var> and its
  [[bpoffset]] is greater than <var>new index</var>, add one to its
  [[bpoffset]].

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[node]] is <var>old parent</var> and its
  [[bpoffset]] is <var>old index</var> or <var>old index</var> + 1, set its
  [[node]] to <var>new parent</var> and add <var>new index</var> &minus;
  <var>old index</var> to its [[bpoffset]].

  <li>If a [[boundarypoint]]'s [[node]] is <var>old parent</var> and its
  [[bpoffset]] is greater than <var>old index</var> + 1, subtract one from its
  [[bpoffset]].

<p class=comments>TODO: Do we want to get rid of attributes that are no longer

<p>To <dfn>set the tag name</dfn> of an [[element]] <var>element</var> to

<p class=note>This is needed because the DOM doesn't allow any way of changing
an existing element's name.  Sometimes we want to, e.g., convert a markup
element to a span.  In that case we invoke this algorithm to create a new
element, move it to the right place, copy attributes from the old element, move
the old element's children, and remove the old element.

<h3>Wrapping a list of nodes</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>To <dfn>wrap</dfn> a list <var>node list</var> of consecutive [[sibling]]
[[nodes]], run the following algorithm.  In addition to <var>node list</var>,
the algorithm accepts two inputs: an algorithm <var>sibling criteria</var> that
accepts a [[node]] as input and outputs a boolean, and an algorithm <var>new
parent instructions</var> that accepts nothing as input and outputs a [[node]]
or null.  If not provided, <var>sibling criteria</var> returns false and
<var>new parent instructions</var> returns null.

<p class=note>This algorithm basically does two things.  First, it looks at the
previous and next siblings of the nodes in <var>node list</var>.  If running
<var>sibling criteria</var> on one or both of the siblings returns true, the
nodes in <var>node list</var> are moved into the sibling(s).  Otherwise,
<var>new parent instructions</var> is run, and the result is used to wrap
<var>node list</var>.  For instance, to wrap <var>node list</var> in a <code
title>&lt;b></code>, one might invoke this algorithm with <var>sibling
criteria</var> returning true only for <code title>&lt;b></code> elements and
<var>new parent instructions</var> creating and returning a new <code
title>&lt;b></code> element.

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments>We need to treat [[br]]s as visible here even if they're
  not, because wrapping them might be significant even if they're invisible: it
  can turn an extraneous line break into a non-extraneous one.

  <p>If every member of <var>node list</var> is <span>invisible</span>, and
  none is a [[br]], return null and abort these steps.

  <li>If <var>node list</var>'s first member's [[parent]] is null, return null
  and abort these steps.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Trailing br's like this always need to go along with their
  line.  Otherwise they'll create an extra line if we wrap in a block element,
  instead of vanishing as they should.

  <p>If <var>node list</var>'s last member is an <span>inline node</span>
  that's not a [[br]], and <var>node list</var>'s last member's [[nextsibling]]
  is a [[br]], append that [[br]] to <var>node list</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>See <a
  href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13811>bug 13811</a>, <a
  href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14231>bug 14231</a>.  If
  there's a non-adjacent sibling that matches the sibling criteria and only
  invisible nodes intervene, we want to skip over the invisible nodes.  For
  instance, bolding {{code|<b>foo</b><!--bar-->[baz]}} should produce
  {{code|<b>foo<!--bar-->baz</b>}}.  Similarly, and more usefully, creating an
  ordered list with {{code|<ol><li>foo</ol> <p>[bar]</p>}} should produce
  {{code|<ol><li>foo</li> <li>[bar]</ol>}}, not
  {{code|<ol><li>foo</ol> <ol><li>[bar]</ol>}}.

  <p>While <var>node list</var>'s first member's [[previoussibling]] is
  <span>invisible</span>, prepend it to <var>node list</var>.

  <li>While <var>node list</var>'s last member's [[nextsibling]] is
  <span>invisible</span>, append it to <var>node list</var>.

  <li>If the [[previoussibling]] of the first member of <var>node list</var>
  is <span>editable</span> and running <var>sibling criteria</var> on it
  returns true, let <var>new parent</var> be the [[previoussibling]] of the
  first member of <var>node list</var>.

  <li>Otherwise, if the [[nextsibling]] of the last member of <var>node
  list</var> is <span>editable</span> and running <var>sibling criteria</var>
  on it returns true, let <var>new parent</var> be the [[nextsibling]] of the
  last member of <var>node list</var>.

  <li>Otherwise, run <var>new parent instructions</var>, and let <var>new
  parent</var> be the result.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>This can only happen if <var>new parent instructions</var>
  is run and it returns null.  This can be used to only merge with adjacent
  siblings, in case you don't want to create a new parent if that fails.

  <p>If <var>new parent</var> is null, abort these steps and return null.

  <li><p class=comments>Most callers will create a new element to return in
  <var>new parent instructions</var>, whose parent will therefore be null.  But
  they can also return an existing node if that makes sense, so the nodes will
  be moved to an uncle or something.  The toggle lists algorithm makes use of
  this.

  <p>If <var>new parent</var>'s [[parent]] is null:

  <ol>
    <li>Insert <var>new parent</var> into the [[parent]] of the first member of
    <var>node list</var> immediately before the first member of <var>node
    list</var>.

    <li>
    <div class=comments>
    <p>Basically, we want any boundary points around the wrapped nodes to go
    inside the wrapper.  Without this step, wrapping "{}&lt;br>" in a blockquote
    would go like

    <pre>
{}&lt;br>
-> {}&lt;blockquote>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br>
-> {}&lt;blockquote>&lt;br>&lt;/blockquote>.</pre>

    <p>The second line is due to range mutation rules: a boundary point with an
    offset equal to the index of a newly-inserted node stays put, so it remains
    before it.  With this step, it goes like

    <pre>
{}&lt;br>
-> {}&lt;blockquote>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br>
-> &lt;blockquote>&lt;/blockquote>{}&lt;br>
-> &lt;blockquote>{}&lt;br>&lt;/blockquote>.</pre>

    <p>The difference in the final step is because we move the &lt;br> "preserving
    ranges".  This means that adjacent boundary points get swept along with it.
    Previously, the &lt;blockquote> intervened, so a boundary point after it would
    get taken along but one before it would not.

    <p>Another solution that one might be tempted to consider would be to just put
    the wrapper after the wrapped elements.  Then the boundary points would
    stay put, before the wrapper, so they'd still be adjacent to the nodes to
    be wrapped, like:

    <pre>
{&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>}
-> {&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>}&lt;blockquote>&lt;/blockquote>
-> &lt;blockquote>{&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>}&lt;/blockquote>.</pre>

    <p>The problem is that this completely breaks if you're wrapping multiple
    things and not all are selected.  It would go like this:

    <pre>
&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>{&lt;p>bar&lt;/p>}
-> &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>{&lt;p>bar&lt;/p>}&lt;blockquote>&lt;/blockquote>
-> &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;blockquote>{&lt;p>bar&lt;/p>}&lt;/blockquote>
-> &lt;blockquote>{&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;p>bar&lt;/p>}&lt;/blockquote>.</pre>

    <p>The last step is again because of the range mutation rules: the boundary
    point stays put when a new node is inserted.  They're fundamentally
    asymmetric.

    <p>An alternative solution would be to define the concept of moving a list of
    adjacent sibling nodes while preserving ranges, and handle this explicitly
    at a more abstract level.

    <p>TODO: Think about this some more.  Maybe there's a better way.

elements.  I mostly got the obsolete element list by testing what Firefox 5.0a2
splits when you do insertHorizontalRule.

<p>TODO: The definitions of prohibited paragraph children and elements with
inline contents should be in the HTML spec (possibly under a different name) so
they don't fall out of sync.  They'll do for now.
</div>

<p>A <dfn>name of an element with inline contents</dfn> is "a", "abbr", "b",
"bdi", "bdo", "cite", "code", "dfn", "em", "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6",
"i", "kbd", "mark", "p", "pre", "q", "rp", "rt", "ruby", "s", "samp", "small",
"span", "strong", "sub", "sup", "u", "var", "acronym", "listing", "strike",
"xmp", "big", "blink", "font", "marquee", "nobr", or "tt".

<p>An <dfn>element with inline contents</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span>
whose [[localname]] is a <span>name of an element with inline contents</span>.

<div class=comments>
<p>TODO: This list doesn't currently match HTML's validity requirements for a
few reasons:

<ol>
  <li>We need to handle invalid elements, which have no conformance
  requirements but should be treated properly.  In particular, they can
  interfere with serialization (e.g., center cannot descend from p).

  <li>Sometimes users give instructions that have to produce invalid DOMs to
  get the expected effect, like indenting the first item of a list.

  <li>The HTML validity requirements are sometimes quite complicated.

  <li>I just haven't had bothered to be systematic about it yet.  I've only
  covered what's come up in my tests.
</ol>

<p>I deliberately allow [[dt]] to contain headers and such, in violation of
HTML.  If I didn't, then when the user tried to formatBlock a [[dt]] as a
header, it would break apart the whole [[dl]], which seems worse.  See <a
href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13201>bug 13201</a>.
</div>

<p>A [[node]] or string <var>child</var> is an <dfn>allowed child</dfn> of a
[[node]] or string <var>parent</var> if the following algorithm returns true:

<p class=note>Often we move around nodes, and sometimes this can result in
unreasonable things like two <code title>&lt;p></code>'s nested inside one
another.  This algorithm checks for DOMs we never want to have, so that other
algorithms can avoid creating them or fix them if they do happen.  The
<span>fix disallowed ancestors</span> algorithm is one frequently-invoked
caller of this algorithm.

<ol>
  <li>If <var>parent</var> is "colgroup", "table", "tbody", "tfoot", "thead",
  "tr", or an <span>HTML element</span> with [[localname]] equal to one of
  those, and <var>child</var> is a [[text]] node whose [[cddata]] does not
  consist solely of [[spacecharacters]], return false.

  <li>
  <p class=comments> Actually, no node can occur in the DOM after plaintext,
  generally.  But let's not get too carried away.

  <p>If <var>parent</var> is "script", "style", "plaintext", or "xmp", or an
  <span>HTML element</span> with [[localname]] equal to one of those, and
  <var>child</var> is not a [[text]] node, return false.

  <li>If <var>child</var> is a [[document]], [[documentfragment]], or
  [[documenttype]], return false.

  <li>If <var>child</var> is an <span>HTML element</span>, set <var>child</var>
  to the [[localname]] of <var>child</var>.

  <li>If <var>child</var> is not a string, return true.

  <li>If <var>parent</var> is an <span>HTML element</span>:

  <ol>
    <li>
    <p class=comments>Cannot be serialized as text/html.  In some cases it can,
    like
    &lt;a>foo&lt;table>&lt;td>&lt;a>bar&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/table>baz&lt;/a>,
    but it's invalid in those cases too, so no need for complication.

    <p>If <var>child</var> is "a", and <var>parent</var> or some [[ancestor]]
    of <var>parent</var> is an [[a]], return false.

    <li>
    <p class=comments>This generally cannot be serialized either, for p.  For
    other elements with inline contents, this serves to prevent things like
    &lt;span>&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;/span>, which will parse fine but aren't
    supposed to happen anyway.

    <p>If <var>child</var> is a <span>prohibited paragraph child name</span>
    and <var>parent</var> or some [[ancestor]] of <var>parent</var> is an
    <span>element with inline contents</span>, return false.

    <li>
    <p class=comments>Also can't be serialized as text/html.

    <p>If <var>child</var> is "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", or "h6", and
    <var>parent</var> or some [[ancestor]] of <var>parent</var> is an
    <span>HTML element</span> with [[localname]] "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5",
    or "h6", return false.

    <li>
    <p class=comments>Further requirements only care about the parent itself,
    not ancestors, so we don't need to know the node itself.

    <p>Let <var>parent</var> be the [[localname]] of <var>parent</var>.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>parent</var> is an [[element]] or [[documentfragment]], return
  true.

  <li>If <var>parent</var> is not a string, return false.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>We allow children even where some intervening nodes will be
  inserted, like tr as a child of table.

  <p>If <var>parent</var> is on the left-hand side of an entry on the
  following list, then return true if <var>child</var> is listed on the
  right-hand side of that entry, and false otherwise.

  <ul>

  "frameset", "head", "html", "tbody", "td", "tfoot", "th", "thead", or "tr",
  return false.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>dd/dt/li will serialize fine as the child of random stuff,
  but it makes no sense at all, so we want to avoid it anyway.

  <p>If <var>child</var> is "dd" or "dt" and <var>parent</var> is not "dl",
  return false.

  <li>If <var>child</var> is "li" and <var>parent</var> is not "ol" or "ul",
  return false.

  <li>If <var>parent</var> is on the left-hand side of an entry on the

<h2 id=inline-formatting-commands>Inline formatting commands</h2>

<h3>Inline formatting command definitions</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=comments>The difference between "contained" and "effectively
contained" is basically that 1) in &lt;b>[foo]&lt;/b>, the text node and the
&lt;b> are effectively contained but not contained; and 2) in
&lt;b>f[o]o&lt;/b>, the text node is effectively contained but not contained,
and the &lt;b> is neither effectively contained nor contained.

<p>A [[node]] <var>node</var> is <dfn>effectively contained</dfn> in a
[[range]] <var>range</var> if <var>range</var> is not [[rangecollapsed]], and
at least one of the following holds:

<ul>
  <li><var>node</var> is [[contained]] in <var>range</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments> So like &lt;b>f[oo]&lt;/b> or &lt;b>f[o]o&lt;/b> or
  &lt;b>f[oo&lt;/b>}, but not &lt;b>foo[&lt;/b>} or &lt;b>f[]oo&lt;/b>.

  <p><var>node</var> is <var>range</var>'s [[startnode]], it is a [[text]]
  node, and its [[length]] is different from <var>range</var>'s
  [[startoffset]].

  <li><var>node</var> is <var>range</var>'s [[endnode]], it is a [[text]] node,
  and <var>range</var>'s [[endoffset]] is not 0.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Basically, anything whose children are all effectively
  contained should be effectively contained itself, except that in a case like
  &lt;b>f[o]o&lt;/b> we don't want &lt;b> to be effectively contained even
  though the text node is.  That's because we split the text node before we
  actually do anything, and the &lt;b> will no longer be effectively contained.

  <p><var>node</var> has at least one [[child]]; and all its [[children]] are
  <span>effectively contained</span> in <var>range</var>; and either
  <var>range</var>'s [[startnode]] is not a [[descendant]] of <var>node</var>
  or is not a [[text]] node or <var>range</var>'s [[startoffset]] is zero; and
  either <var>range</var>'s [[endnode]] is not a [[descendant]] of
  <var>node</var> or is not a [[text]] node or <var>range</var>'s [[endoffset]]
  is its [[endnode]]'s [[length]].
</ul>

<p>A <dfn>modifiable element</dfn> is a [[b]], [[em]], [[i]], [[s]], [[span]],
[[strike]], [[strong]], [[sub]], [[sup]], or [[u]] element with no attributes
except possibly [[style]]; or a [[font]] element with no attributes except
possibly [[style]], [[fontcolor]], [[fontface]], and/or [[fontsize]]; or an
[[a]] element with no attributes except possibly [[style]] and/or [[href]].

<p>A <dfn>simple modifiable element</dfn> is an <span>HTML element</span> for
which at least one of the following holds:

<ul>
  <li>It is an [[a]], [[b]], [[em]], [[font]], [[i]], [[s]], [[span]],
  [[strike]], [[strong]], [[sub]], [[sup]], or [[u]] element with no
  attributes.

  <li>It is an [[a]], [[b]], [[em]], [[font]], [[i]], [[s]], [[span]],
  [[strike]], [[strong]], [[sub]], [[sup]], or [[u]] element with exactly one
  attribute, which is [[style]], which sets no CSS properties (including
  invalid or unrecognized properties).

  <li>It is an [[a]] element with exactly one attribute, which is [[href]].

  <li>It is a [[font]] element with exactly one attribute, which is either
  [[fontcolor]], [[fontface]], or [[fontsize]].

  <li>It is a [[b]] or [[strong]] element with exactly one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties), which is "font-weight".

  <li>It is an [[i]] or [[em]] element with exactly one attribute, which is
  [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties), which is "font-style".

  <li>It is an [[a]], [[font]], or [[span]] element with exactly one attribute,
  which is [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute sets exactly one CSS property
  (including invalid or unrecognized properties), and that property is not
  "text-decoration".

  <li>It is an [[a]], [[font]], [[s]], [[span]], [[strike]], or [[u]] element
  with exactly one attribute, which is [[style]], and the [[style]] attribute
  sets exactly one CSS property (including invalid or unrecognized properties),
  which is "text-decoration", which is set to "line-through" or "underline" or
  "overline" or "none".
</ul>

<p class=note>Conceptually, a simple modifiable element is a modifiable element
which specifies a value for at most one command.  As the names imply, inline
formatting commands will try not to modify anything other than modifiable
elements.  For instance, <code title>&lt;dfn></code> normally creates italics,
but it's not modifiable, so running <span>the <code title>italic</code>
command</span> will not remove it: it will nest <code title>&lt;span
style="font-style: normal"></code> inside.

<p>A <dfn>formattable node</dfn> is an <span>editable</span>
<span>visible</span> [[node]] that is either a [[text]] node, an [[img]], or a
[[br]].

<p>Two quantities are <dfn>equivalent values</dfn> for a <span>command</span>
if either both are null, or both are strings and they're equal and the
<span>command</span> does not define any <span>equivalent values</span>, or
both are strings and the <span>command</span> defines <span>equivalent
values</span> and they match the definition.

<p>Two quantities are <dfn>loosely equivalent values</dfn> for a
<span>command</span> if either they are <span>equivalent values</span> for the
<span>command</span>, or if the <span>command</span> is <span>the <code
title>fontSize</code> command</span>; one of the quantities is one of
"xx-small", "small", "medium", "large", "x-large", "xx-large", or "xxx-large";
and the other quantity is the [[resval]] of "font-size" on a [[font]] element
whose [[fontsize]] attribute has the corresponding value set ("1" through "7"
respectively).

<p class=note>Loose equivalence needs to be used when comparing effective
command values to other values, while regular equivalence is used in other
cases.  The effective command value for fontSize is converted to pixels, so
comparing it to a specified value literally would produce false negatives.  But
a <em>specified</em> value in pixels is actually different from a
<em>specified</em> value like "small" or "x-large", because there is no precise
mapping from such keywords to pixels.

<p>If a <span>command</span> has <dfn>inline command activated values</dfn>
defined but nothing else defines when it is <span>indeterminate</span>, it is
<span>indeterminate</span> if among <span title="formattable node">formattable
nodes</span> <span>effectively contained</span> in the <span>active
range</span>, there is at least one whose <span>effective command value</span>
is one of the given values and at least one whose <span>effective command
value</span> is not one of the given values.

<p class=comments>For bold and similar commands, IE 9 RC seems to consider the
state true or false depending on the first element.  All other browsers follow
the same general idea as the spec, considering a range bold only if all text in
it is bold, and this seems to match at least OpenOffice.org's bold feature.
Opera 11.11 seemingly doesn't take CSS into account, and only looks at whether
something descends from a &lt;b>.  I couldn't properly test IE9 because it
threw exceptions (Error: Unspecified error.) on most of the tests I ran.  But
what I have here seems to match Firefox 6.0a2 in every case, and Chrome 14 dev
in all cases with a few exceptions.

<p>If a <span>command</span> has <span>inline command activated values</span>
defined, its <span>state</span> is true if either no <span>formattable
node</span> is <span>effectively contained</span> in the <span>active
range</span>, and the <span>active range</span>'s [[startnode]]'s
<span>effective command value</span> is one of the given values; or if there is
at least one <span>formattable node</span> <span>effectively contained</span>
in the <span>active range</span>, and all of them have an <span>effective
command value</span> equal to one of the given values.

<div class=comments>
<p>Testing with hiliteColor: Opera 11.11 seems to always return the effective
command value of the active range's start node.  Chrome 14 dev returns boolean
false consistently, bizarrely enough.  Firefox 6.0a2 seems to follow the same
idea as the spec, but it likes to return "transparent", including sometimes
when the answer really clearly should not be "transparent".  IE9 throws
exceptions most of the time for backColor, so I can't say for sure, but in the
few cases where it doesn't throw it returns a random-looking number, so I'll
assume it's crazy like for foreColor.

<p>I decided on something that would guarantee the following invariant: whenever
you execute a command with a value provided (assuming value is relevant),
queryCommandValue() will always return something equivalent to what you set.
</div>

<p>If a command is a <dfn>standard inline value command</dfn>, it is
<span>indeterminate</span> if among <span title="formattable node">formattable
nodes</span> that are <span>effectively contained</span> in the <span>active
range</span>, there are two that have distinct <span title="effective command
value">effective command values</span>.  Its <span>value</span> is the
<span>effective command value</span> of the first <span>formattable node</span>
that is <span>effectively contained</span> in the <span>active range</span>; or
if there is no such node, the <span>effective command value</span> of the
<span>active range</span>'s [[startnode]]; or if that is null, the empty
string.

<p class=note>The notions of inline command activated values and standard
inline value commands are mostly just shorthand to avoid repeating the same
boilerplate half a dozen times.

<!-- @} -->
<h3>Assorted inline formatting command algorithms</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>The <dfn>effective command value</dfn> of a [[node]] <var>node</var> for a
given <var>command</var> is returned by the following algorithm, which will
return either a string or null:

<p class=note>This is logically somewhat like CSS computed or resolved values,
and in fact for most commands it's identical to CSS resolved values (see the
end of the algorithm).  We need a separate concept for some commands where we
can't rely on CSS for some reason: createLink and unlink aren't CSS-related at
all, backColor and hiliteColor need special treatment because background-color
isn't an inherited property, subscript and superscript rely on <code
title>&lt;sub></code>/<code title>&lt;sup></code> instead of CSS
vertical-align, and strikethrough and underline don't map to unique CSS
properties.

<ol>
  <li>If neither <var>node</var> nor its [[parent]] is an [[element]], return
  null.

  <li>If <var>node</var> is not an [[element]], return the <span>effective
  command value</span> of its [[parent]] for <var>command</var>.

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "createLink" or "unlink":

  <ol>
    <li>While <var>node</var> is not null, and is not an [[a]] element that has
    an [[href]] attribute, set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].

    <li>If <var>node</var> is null, return null.

    <li>Return the [[attrvalue]] of <var>node</var>'s [[href]] attribute.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "backColor" or "hiliteColor":

  <ol>
    <li>While the [[resval]] of "background-color" on <var>node</var> is
    any fully transparent value, and <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is an
    [[element]], set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].

    <li>
    <div class=comments>
    <p>What happens if everything's background is fully transparent?  See <a
    href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14068>bug</a>.  If you
    do queryCommandValue() for backColor/hiliteColor when no backgrounds are
    set anywhere, so it goes up to the root element, no two engines agree.
    IE10PP2 just returns a random-looking number (16777215).  Firefox 8.0a2
    returns "transparent", Chrome 15 dev returns "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", and Opera
    11.50 returns "rgb(255, 255, 255)".

    <p>Opera's behavior is incorrect.  The current page might be an iframe, in
    which case the background really will be transparent and the (inaccessible)
    background color of the parent page will show through.  Also, the user
    might have changed their preferences, but I'm not too worried about that.

    <p>So instead we just return the value as-is.  This means that it will be
    fully transparent, which is perhaps somewhat useless information, but it's
    the best we can do.  More generally, any non-opaque value is not going to
    tell you what you actually want, namely "what color is the user actually
    seeing?"  We have no realistic way to work around this in the general case.
    </div>

    <p>Return the [[resval]] of "background-color" for <var>node</var>.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "subscript" or "superscript":

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>affected by subscript</var> and <var>affected by
    superscript</var> be two boolean variables, both initially false.

    <li>While <var>node</var> is an <span>inline node</span>:

    <ol>
      <li>
      <p class=comments>Firefox 6.0a2 ignores vertical-align for this purpose,
      and only cares about &lt;sub> and &lt;sup> tags themselves.  Opera 11.11
      is similar, and in fact behaves like that even for commands like bold.
      The spec originally followed Chrome 14 dev, mainly because WebKit itself
      will produce spans with vertical-align sub or super, and we want to
      handle them correctly.  However, Ryosuke <a
      href=http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-August/032809.html>informs</a>
      me that WebKit's behavior here is viewed as <a
      href=https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11089>a bug</a>, so I
      changed it to match Gecko/Opera.

      <p>If <var>node</var> is a [[sub]], set <var>affected by subscript</var>
      to true.

      <li>Otherwise, if <var>node</var> is a [[sup]], set <var>affected by
      superscript</var> to true.

      <li>Set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].
    </ol>

    <li>If <var>affected by subscript</var> and <var>affected by
    superscript</var> are both true, return the string "mixed".

    <li>If <var>affected by subscript</var> is true, return "subscript".

    <li>If <var>affected by superscript</var> is true, return "superscript".

    <li>Return null.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "strikethrough", and the "text-decoration"
  property of <var>node</var> or any of its [[ancestors]] has [[resval]]
  containing "line-through", return "line-through".  Otherwise, return null.

  <li>If <var>command</var> is "underline", and the "text-decoration"
  property of <var>node</var> or any of its [[ancestors]] has [[resval]]
  containing "underline", return "underline".  Otherwise, return null.

  <li>Return the [[resval]] for <var>node</var> of the <span>relevant CSS
  property</span> for <var>command</var>.
</ol>

<p>The <dfn>specified command value</dfn> of an [[element]] <var>element</var>
for a given <var>command</var> is returned by the following algorithm, which
will return either a string or null:

<p class=note>This is logically somewhat like CSS inline style.  In addition to
the caveats for effective command value, we also treat elements like <code
title>&lt;b></code> and <code title>&lt;font></code> as having the same meaning
as <code title>&lt;span></code>s with inline style set, because they're
logically pretty much the same and can in fact be produced by the same command
depending on the <span>CSS styling flag</span>.

<ol>
  <li>If <var>command</var> is "backColor" or "hiliteColor" and the
  [[element]]'s display property does not have [[resval]] "inline", return
  null.

<span>the <code title>outdent</code> command</span> on it, the blockquote will
be removed and the style will go along with it.  Recording the values of its

change color when outdented.

<h3>Pushing down values</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=comments>
<p>This algorithm goes up to just below the nearest ancestor with the right
style, then re-applies the bad styles repeatedly going down, omitting the
things we want to have the new style.  This is basically what WebKit does,
although WebKit sometimes starts higher up and therefore makes more intrusive
changes, often creating more markup.  IE follows the same general approach too.

<p>Gecko instead seems to start breaking up elements from the bottom, so that the
range consists of a few consecutive siblings, and it can then break up the
problematic element into a maximum of two pieces.  The spec's approach seems to
create fewer elements and simpler markup (or at least markup that's no more
complex) in most cases I throw at it.

<p>Gecko's approach does have the major advantage that it gets underlines right in
many cases for free.  E.g.,

<pre>
&lt;u>foo&lt;font color=red>[bar]baz&lt;/font>&lt;/u>
-> &lt;u>foo&lt;/u>&lt;font color=red>bar&lt;u>baz&lt;/u>&lt;/font> (spec)
-> &lt;u>foo&lt;/u>&lt;font color=red>bar&lt;/font>&lt;u>&lt;font color=red>baz&lt;/font>&lt;/u> (Gecko)</pre>

<p>The spec's markup here is much shorter and contains fewer elements, but is
wrong: the underline under "baz" has changed color from black to red.  It might
be worth trying to copy Gecko's results in such cases, but that won't solve all
underline problems, so perhaps it's not worth it.

<p>Opera also seems to break up the markup surrounding the range, but even more
aggressively: even if it doesn't need to pull down styles.  In some cases this
does actually result in shorter markup, specifically if the existing tags are
short (like i or b) and we're adding tags that are long (like span with a style
attribute).
</div>

<p>To <dfn>push down values</dfn> to a [[node]] <var>node</var>, given a new
value <var>new value</var>:

<p class=note>The idea here is that if an undesired value is being propagated
from an ancestor, we remove that style from the ancestor and re-apply it to all
the descendants other than <var>node</var>.  This way we don't have to have
nested styles, which is usually more cluttered (although not always).

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>command</var> be the current <span>command</span>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>E.g., a text node child of a document fragment.

  <p>If <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is not an [[element]], abort this
  algorithm.

  <li>If the <span>effective command value</span> of <var>command</var> is
  [[looselyequivalent]] to <var>new value</var> on <var>node</var>, abort this
  algorithm.

  <li>Let <var>current ancestor</var> be <var>node</var>'s [[parent]].

  <li>Let <var>ancestor list</var> be a list of [[nodes]], initially empty.

  <li>While <var>current ancestor</var> is an <span>editable</span> [[element]]
  and the <span>effective command value</span> of <var>command</var> is not
  [[looselyequivalent]] to <var>new value</var> on it, append <var>current
  ancestor</var> to <var>ancestor list</var>, then set <var>current
  ancestor</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>If <var>ancestor list</var> is empty, abort this algorithm.

  <li>Let <var>propagated value</var> be the <span>specified command
  value</span> of <var>command</var> on the last member of <var>ancestor
  list</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>We can only remove specified values, so if the value isn't
  specified, give up.  Unless we're actually trying to push down a null
  specified value, like for unlink.

  <p>If <var>propagated value</var> is null and is not equal to <var>new
  value</var>, abort this algorithm.

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>If we go all the way up to the root and still don't have the desired value,
  pushing down values is pointless.  It will create extra markup for no
  purpose.  Except if the value is null, which basically just means "try to get
  rid of anything affecting the current element but don't aim for any specific
  value".

  <p>Nevertheless, Chrome 14 dev does seem to do this.  Running bold on
  &lt;span style=font-weight:300>f[o]o&lt;/span> breaks up the span and adds a
  &lt;b> as a sibling.  In IE9, Firefox 6.0a2, and Opera 11.50, it instead
  nests the &lt;b> inside the &lt;span>.  It's a tradeoff: WebKit's behavior is
  better for things like

<pre>
&lt;font color=red>fo[o&lt;/font>&lt;font color=blue>b]ar&lt;/font>
-> &lt;font color=red>fo&lt;/font>&lt;font color=green>[ob]&lt;/font>&lt;font color=blue>ar&lt;/font></pre>

  <p>(where the spec adds two extra font tags instead of one), but the spec is
  simpler for things like

<pre>
&lt;font color=red>f[o]o&lt;/font>
-> &lt;font color=red>f&lt;font color=green>[o]&lt;/font>o&lt;/font></pre>

  <p>(where WebKit splits the existing tag up in addition to creating a new tag).
  I'm not particularly sure which approach is better overall, so I'll go with
  the majority of browsers.  If these algorithms move to use runs of
  consecutive siblings instead of doing everything node-by-node, it might make
  sense to break up the parent as long as it won't create an extra node (i.e.,
  we're styling something that includes the first or last child).

<h3>Forcing the value of a node</h3>

<p class=note>This algorithm checks if the node has the desired value, and if

    <div class=comments>

<h3>Setting the selection's value</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>To <dfn>set the selection's value</dfn> to <var>new value</var>:

<div class=note>
<p>The effect of this algorithm is to ensure that all nodes <span>effectively
contained</span> in the selection have the value requested, producing the
simplest markup possible to achieve that effect.  It's inspired by the approach
WebKit takes.  The only places where the algorithm should fail are when there's
an !important CSS rule that conflicts with the requested style (which we don't
try to override because we assume it's !important for a reason), or when it's
literally impossible to succeed (such as when a text-decoration or link URL is
propagated from a non-editable ancestor).  Any other failures are bugs.

<p>First, if a node has a <span>specified command value</span> for the command,
we unset it (<span title="clear the value">clear its value</span>).  This step
also removes <span title="simple modifiable element">simple modifiable
elements</span> entirely, and replaces elements like [[b]] or [[font]] with
[[span]]s if they aren't simple modifiable elements.  This will be sufficient
if the desired value is inherited from an ancestor, or if it's the default
(like font-style: normal) and no conflicting value is inherited from an
ancestor.  Even if clearing values doesn't actually fix the style of the node
we're dealing with, we do it anyway to simplify the generated markup.

<p>If clearing values didn't work, and it looks like an ancestor has a
<span>specified command value</span> that we're inheriting, we push the value
down from that ancestor.  Thus if we're unbolding the letter "r" in

<xmp><b>foo <i>bar</i> baz</b>,</xmp>

<p>we get

<xmp><b>foo </b><i><b>ba</b>r</i><b> baz</b>.</xmp>

<p>If we didn't push down values, the final step (forcing values) would instead
give us

<xmp><b>foo <i>ba<span style="font-weight: normal">r</span></i> baz</b>,</xmp>

<p>which is much longer and uglier.  We take care not to disturb the style or
semantics of anything but the node we're dealing with.

<p>We'll only push down values if some ancestor actually has the value we want,
so we can inherit it.  Otherwise, it will just create useless markup.

<p>Finally, if neither of the above strategies worked, we have to add new
markup to get the desired value (<span title="force the value">forcing the
value</span>).  First we try just sticking it into its previous or next
sibling, if that's a <span>simple modifiable element</span> (so it won't add
any styles or semantics we don't want).  Otherwise, we create a new simple
modifiable element and wrap it in that.  It's common that a previous sibling is
the simple modifiable element we want, because often we'll set the value of
several consecutive siblings in succession.  In that case, the element created
for the first can be reused for the later ones.

<p>This last step works a bit differently if the node isn't an <span>allowed
child</span> of "span".  In that case, wrapping it in a simple modifiable element
would make the document less conforming than it already was, or would cause
other problems.  Instead, we recursively force the value of its children.  The
recursion will terminate when we hit a node that's an allowed child of "span",
or when there are no further descendants.  (In the latter case, there are no
descendants that are text nodes or such, so we don't really need to style
anything.)

<p>After all this, the node is guaranteed to have the value we want, barring
bugs in the algorithm or the two exceptions noted earlier (!important style
rules, and impossible cases).  We then re-run the algorithm on each child
recursively.  Typically this means just clearing the value of each descendant,
because it should then inherit the value we just set on its ancestor.  In the
unusual case that a descendant's value is wrong even after we clear its value,
such as because of a non-inline style rule (like trying to unbold a heading),
we'll repeat the above steps to ensure that the value really gets set as
desired.

    <dt>Firefox 4.0
    <dd>Ignores execCommand() if the start and end of the selection are not
    both editable.  If the start and end are editable but something in the

    something like that.

    <dd>Ignores execCommand() if the start and end of the selection are not

    But the state doesn't ignore the non-editable parts, so if you bold such a
    selection you can't unbold it, for instance, since the middle part will
    remain bold (so it will keep on trying to bold it instead of switching to
    unbold).

    <dt>Opera 11.00

  <p>I chose to go with the non-IE behavior, per <a
  href=http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-April/031147.html>discussion</a>.
  Ignoring non-editable things is convenient for the common use-case of an
  editor, where you don't want the user to bold random parts of the UI when
  they hit the bold button.  For cases where it's not desired, you can always
  turn designMode on briefly before using execCommand(), so the non-IE behavior
  is a lot easier to work around than the IE behavior.

  <p>I don't see the value in ever just ignoring execCommand().  If the start
  and end are not editable, I'm going to say you should still style any
  editable nodes in between.  I'm also going to ignore non-editable nodes for
  the purposes of determining state, so (for instance) if all the editable
  nodes are bolded, it will unbold instead of bolding.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>backColor</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=note>For historical reasons, backColor and hiliteColor behave
identically.

<div class=comments>
<p>We have three behaviors to choose from for this one:

<ol>
  <li>Chrome 11 dev and IE 9 RC treat it the same as hiliteColor (although IE 9
  RC doesn't support hiliteColor itself).

  <li>Firefox 4 in non-CSS mode sets the bgcolor of the nearest td or body, or
  something like that.  In testing, it seems to jump out of contenteditable
  elements to style non-editable ancestors, which is alarming.

  <li>Firefox 4 in CSS mode and Opera 11 set the background of the nearest
  block container, although it doesn't seem to be very dependable (probably I
  just don't get what exactly it's doing).
</ol>

<p>(1) is obviously redundant, but has plurality support, so we could spec it
that way if the other ways were useless.

<p>(3) is incoherent from a user perspective.  For instance, if you try it on
paragraphs the background will have big gaps where the margins are.  If you try
it on an inline element that's a child of the editing host, it will do nothing
or apply the background to everything or such, even though such an inline
element is visually indistinguishable from one sitting inside a div.  This
would only make sense if we take considerable effort to ensure that block
elements all have no margins, or if we wrap things in a div if they have
margins, or something like that.

<p>That leaves (2).  That might be useful if it actually set the document's
background color, but it seems like it sets table cell backgrounds sometimes
instead, which is really confusing.

<p>The path of least resistance is to standardize this as meaning the same
thing as hiliteColor, and make up new commands if we want to do things like set
the document background color.  See hiliteColor for comments.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>bold</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=comments>If the selection is collapsed (but not if it contains nothing
but is not collapsed), IE9 wraps the whole line in a &lt;strong>.  This seems
bizarre and no one else does it, so I don't do it.  It's a similar story for
similar commands (fontName, italic, etc.).  Except not for strikethrough, where
it just does nothing if the selection is empty.  Why strikethrough?  I don't
know.

<p><span>Action</span>: If <code

<p>The cutoff of 600 matches Chrome 14 dev.  The cutoff used by IE9 and Firefox
6.0a2 seems to be 500, and the distinction isn't relevant for Opera 11.11 (it
doesn't use CSS here at all AFAICT).  On my test systems with default fonts,
Chrome 14 dev displays 700 and up as bold, while the other three display 600
and up as bold.

<p>Thus in Chrome on my system, the bold command will behave a bit oddly the first
time you hit it if there's anything in the range with font-weight: 600, but it
will look right in other browsers.  On the other hand, if I followed
IE/Firefox, it would look wrong on all my browsers for font-weight: 500.

<p>700 actually makes more sense: then you'd view 100-300 as light, 400-600 as
medium, 700-900 as bold.  But that's not how it seems to work in browsers, so
I'll go with 600 as the cutoff.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>createLink</code> command</dfn></h3>

<div class=comments>
<p>If the selection doesn't contain anything (meaning, e.g., deleteContents()
doesn't change anything), then Chrome 12 dev inserts a link at the selection
start, with the text equal to the link URL.  Other browsers don't do it, so I
don't either.

<p>IE10PP2, Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev, and Opera 11.50 all do not support
indeterminate, state, or value for createLink or unlink.  I previously defined
indeterminate and value anyway because they make sense, but then <a
href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14067>undefined them</a>.
The nontrivial thing is what value to return if there's no link, since any
string can occur as a link href, in principle.

<p>What are the use-cases for indeterm, state, or value for createLink/unlink?
</div>

<p><span>Action</span>:

<ol>
  <li>
  <p class=comments> Firefox 4b11 and Chrome 11 dev both silently do nothing in
  this case.  IE 9 RC and Opera 11 both treat the request literally.  Gecko and
  WebKit probably have it right here: users who enter no URL are very unlikely
  to want to link to a relative URL resolving to the current document.  If they
  really want to, they can always specify "#" for the value, or the author can
  rewrite it, so it's not like this makes the API less useful.

  <p>If <var>value</var> is the empty string, abort these steps and do
  nothing.

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>There are three approaches here.  For instance, if you ask browsers to
  create a link to "http://example.org" on the "b" here:

    <pre>&lt;a href=http://example.com>&lt;b>Abc&lt;/b>&lt;/a></pre>

  <p>Chrome 10 dev produces:

    <pre>&lt;b>&lt;a href=http://example.com>A&lt;/a>&lt;a href=http://example.org>b&lt;/a>&lt;a href=http://example.com>c&lt;/a>&lt;/b></pre>

  <p>Firefox 4b11 produces (roughly):

    <pre>&lt;a href=http://example.com>&lt;b>A&lt;a href=http://example.org>b&lt;/a>c&lt;/b>&lt;/a></pre>

  <p>(This doesn't round-trip through text/html serialization.)  IE 9 RC and Opera
  11 produce simply:

    <pre>&lt;a href=http://example.org>&lt;b>Abc&lt;/b>&lt;/a></pre>

  <p>The last behavior probably best matches user expectations.  If you happen to
  miss out a character when selecting the link you want to change, do you
  really intend to only change the link of part of it?

  <p>For each <span>editable</span> [[a]] element that has an [[href]]

<p>Setting an empty font-family has the effect of inheriting the font from the

that).  Thus it makes sense that if we special-case this, it should be to unset
the font somehow.

<p>Special-casing the empty string to do nothing doesn't make sense to me.  With
createLink we'd expect the user to enter the URL themselves, so it makes sense
to special-case clicking OK without entering anything.  But here it's very
likely that the font list will be fixed by the author (how many users will
understand CSS font-family syntax?), so I don't think such usability concerns
apply.

  <li><span data-anolis-spec=html>Strip leading and trailing whitespace</span>
  from <var>value</var>.

  <li>If <var>value</var> is not a <span data-anolis-spec=html>valid floating

  floating point number</span> if a single leading "+" character were stripped,
  abort these steps and do nothing.

  <li>If the first character of <var>value</var> is "+", delete the character
  and let <var>mode</var> be "relative-plus".

  <li>Otherwise, if the first character of <var>value</var> is "-", delete the
  character and let <var>mode</var> be "relative-minus".

  <li>Otherwise, let <var>mode</var> be "absolute".

  <li>Apply the <span data-anolis-spec=html>rules for parsing non-negative
  integers</span> to <var>value</var>, and let <var>number</var> be the result.

  <li>If <var>mode</var> is "relative-plus", add three to <var>number</var>.

  <li>If <var>mode</var> is "relative-minus", negate <var>number</var>, then
  add three to it.

  <li>If <var>number</var> is less than one, let <var>number</var> equal 1.

  <li>If <var>number</var> is greater than seven, let <var>number</var> equal
  7.

  <li>Set <var>value</var> to the string here corresponding to
  <var>number</var>:

  <p class=comments>The entry for 7 here is an issue: there's no CSS value that
  corresponds to it.  Even if we got one added to the drafts, it wouldn't be
  backward-compatible to use it.  WebKit is the only engine that supports CSS
  output for fontSize, and it uses -webkit-xxx-large in this case, which is
  unworkable.  Instead, we just always output a font tag for size 7.  If
  authors want conforming markup, they'll need to give CSS sizes above size 7,
  not legacy sizes.

  <ul>
    <li>1: xx-small
    <li>2: small
    <li>3: medium
    <li>4: large
    <li>5: x-large
    <li>6: xx-large
    <li>7: xxx-large
  </ul>

  <li><span>Set the selection's value</span> to <var>value</var>.
</ol>

<p class=comments>This follows Firefox 6.0a2.  Chrome 14 dev always returns
false.  Note that indeterminacy here keys off the effective command value,
while the value is based only on an approximation (a number from one to seven).
Thus it's possible for every subrange of the selection to have the same value,
but for the selection to still be indeterminate.  Setting the fontSize to the
value will make it determinate without changing anything's value.

<p><span>Indeterminate</span>: True if among <span title="formattable
node">formattable nodes</span> that are <span>effectively contained</span> in
the <span>active range</span>, there are two that have distinct <span
title="effective command value">effective command values</span>.  Otherwise
false.

<div class=comments>
<dl>
  <dt>IE9
  <dd>Seems to return a number based on the computed font-size, but only if
  it's exactly right, otherwise it returns null.  Something like that.

  <dt>Firefox 6.0a2
  <dd>Seemingly goes up to the nearest ancestor that's a &lt;font size> and
  returns the literal value of that attribute, or "" if there's no such
  ancestor.

  <dt>Chrome 14 dev
  <dd>Gets the computed font-size in pixels, and rounds to the nearest &lt;font
  size> equivalent, rounding up in the event of a tie.  Except that if it's
  small enough, it returns "0", which doesn't make sense because that behaves
  the same as "1".

  <dt>Opera 11.11
  <dd>Like Firefox, except it returns "3" if there's no &lt;font size>
  ancestor, and it converts relative values to absolute ("+1" -> "4").
</dl>

<p>Chrome's behavior seems the most useful.  As usual, IE returns a variable
type and all other browsers return strings, and we follow other browsers.

<p>If the selection isn't someplace editable, Chrome works like usual; some
other browsers behave differently.  I see no reason to behave differently.

<p>The interpretations given for Firefox are only in styleWithCSS mode.  In
non-styleWithCSS mode, it just outputs the string literally as the &lt;font
color> attribute value, which can lead to different results.  The given output
for Chrome is for &lt;font>; the output in styleWithCSS mode is the same, but
rgb() is used instead of hex notation, and "transparent" and "currentcolor" are
passed through under those names.  IE and Opera only support &lt;font> to begin
with.

<p>Conclusions:

<ul>
  <li>Everyone accepts simple color keywords and #xxxxxx notation.

  <li>Opera mangles #xxx, but everyone else handles it fine.

  <li>The leading # is optional in all browsers but Gecko.

  <li>rgb() is accepted by everyone but Opera.

  <li>rgba() and hsl() are accepted by Gecko and WebKit, but rejected by IE and
  Opera.

  <li>IE and Opera mangle unrecognized stuff, Gecko and WebKit ignore.

  <li>Browsers will happily output stuff like "transparent" and "rgba()" into
  &lt;font color> even though it won't be uniformly accepted there.

  <li>Opera and WebKit normalize the output color very aggressively, Gecko
  leaves keywords intact but otherwise normalizes for CSS output (but doesn't
  normalize at all for &lt;font>), and IE normalizes inconsistently.
</ul>

<p>What I'm going to say is that it either has to be a valid CSS color, or
prefixing it with # must result in a valid CSS color.  For {{code|<font>}},
I'll say that the output color should be normalized to #xxxxxx form.  If the
color is not a simple color (fully opaque with all channels between 0 and 255),
I'll force {{code|style=""}} even if styleWithCSS mode is off.  Some of this
disagrees with all browsers, but it's unlikely to hurt and it makes sense.

<div class=comments>
<p>Opera 11 seems to return true for the state if there's some
color style applied, false otherwise, which seems fairly useless; authors want
to use value here, not state.  So I'll match other browsers and not define any
state.

<p>For value, the spec essentially matches Firefox 6.0a2 and Chrome 14 dev, as
far as how to decide what color the node has.  IE9 seems to always return the
number 0 for some bizarre reason.  There are some cases where Firefox returns
the empty string for some reason, and it seems to select the active node a
little differently.  Opera uses #xxxxxx format for getComputedStyle() but rgb()
here, and also drops the transparent part of the color if there is any.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>hiliteColor</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=note>For historical reasons, backColor and hiliteColor behave
identically.

<div class=comments>
<p>IE 9 RC doesn't support this.  It uses backColor instead, but Gecko and
Opera treat that differently, while all non-IE browsers treat hiliteColor the
same, so I'm standardizing hiliteColor as the way to highlight text.

<p>This is slightly tricky, because background-color does different things on
block and inline elements.  Given the name ("hiliteColor"), we really only want
to apply it to inline elements.  This is how everyone but Gecko behaves, but
Gecko sometimes applies it to blocks too.  WebKit doesn't set it on non-inline
elements, but does clear it and push it down from them.

<p>The spec doesn't do any of these: background-color on non-inline elements is
not touched by hiliteColor, neither created nor removed.  If users want to
remove the style, they need to use removeFormat.  Adding it usually makes no
sense; see the comment for backColor.

<li>acronym, bdo, q: left alone only by Opera

<li>bdi, del, mark, span, svg: treated the same as unknown elements
</ul>

<p>All elements whose default rendering is display: block are left untouched by
all browsers (although IE seems to throw an exception on &lt;marquee> for some
reason).

<p>It's not clear to me why we should leave &lt;a> alone, but everyone but Opera
does.  In OpenOffice.org 3.2.1, doing "Default Formatting (Ctrl+M)" doesn't
remove links.  In Microsoft Word 2007, doing "Clear Formatting" also doesn't
remove links.  Verdict: don't remove links.  Apparently they don't logically
qualify as "formatting".

<p>Conclusion: IE/WebKit is a solid majority by market share and they're
closely interoperable, since WebKit copied IE here.  Also, it makes more sense
to assume that unrecognized elements don't represent any kind of inline
formatting, i.e., have a blacklist of elements to remove instead of a whitelist
to keep.  Thus I remove more or less the same things as IE/WebKit.

<p>I remove blink because IE does it and it makes sense, although Chrome
doesn't; I remove abbr although only Firefox does, for consistency with
acronym; and I remove bdi and mark because they're evidently left alone only
because they're unrecognized.  Finally, I remove span because otherwise,
something like <code title>&lt;span style="font-variant: small-caps"></code>
will be left intact, which isn't expected and matches no browser except IE.
(Chrome doesn't remove spans in general, but it does remove spans with style
attributes, or something like that.)

<p>Browsers will split up all these inline elements if the selection is contained
within them.  Opera does strip unrecognized elements with display: block if
they're within the selection, but doesn't split them up if they contain the
selection.

<p>Chrome 14 dev removes style attributes from every element in the range, but
IE10PP2, Firefox 7.0a2, and Opera 11.50 do not, so I go with them.  As noted
above, this means I need to remove spans.  I could conceivably change to remove
only spans with style attributes, but it doesn't seem worth it: I'll just match
Gecko.

<p>TODO: This has to be kept in sync when new HTML elements are added.  I need
to figure out some way of coordinating this.

<p class=comments> For &lt;sup>&lt;sub>foo&lt;/sub>&lt;/sup>, Firefox 6.0a2 and
Opera 11.11 say the state is true for both superscript and subscript, and
indeterminate is false; Chrome 14 dev says it's true for subscript but not
superscript, and indeterminate is false.  We follow neither of these behaviors:
we return false for both states, and say indeterminate is true.  The reason is
because we want to return true for a state if we'll do nothing, false if we'll
do something; and if we have nesting like this, we'll always do something,
namely get rid of all those ancestors and replace them with a single tag.  This
matches what happens in other indeterminate situations, so it's fair to
consider it indeterminate.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>underline</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=comments>
<p>TODO: There are a lot of problems with underline color and thickness,
because text-decoration in CSS is horrible.  These aren't prohibitive for
normal use and existing browsers don't handle them either, so fixing these
problems or working around them can be put off for now.

<ul>
  <li>Pushing down underlines can change their color, since the color of an
  underline follows the color of the element where it's declared instead of the
  text it's drawn under.  This could be fixed by adding a special case for this
  condition and inserting extra color rules, such as by setting a color on the
  underlining element and then having another element inside it that resets the
  color.  Horrible, but that's text-decoration for you.  Alternatively, the new
  text-decoration-color property in the CSS 3 Text draft could come in handy
  here, in which case we'd degrade pretty gracefully in legacy UAs.

  <li>Underline thickness depends on font-size in all rendering engines but
  WebKit, so pushing them down creates thickness problems as well as color
  problems.  Working around this is a similar story to the previous, except we
  have no text-decoration-width property yet (see <a
  href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0593.html>www-style
  post</a>).

  <li>The preceding two points can't be avoided, because the only way to remove
  underlines in CSS is to push down styles (unlike most other things where you
  could override it).  Recent (February 2011) CSS 3 Text drafts have added
  support for a "text-decoration-line: cancel-underline" property, but we can
  only use that if there's no other possibility, since it won't work in legacy
  browsers.  (Although we should use it once there's no other possibility.)

  <li>More generally, from a user's perspective, color and thickness of
  underlines is going to be more or less random if they're applying them to
  text with varying size or color.  If they underline a bunch of text all at
  once, it will all get the same color/thickness, probably.  But if they
  underline letter-by-letter, it probably will vary.  But sometimes when they
  underline a bunch of text at once it will also vary, if the algorithm decides
  to create multiple elements for whatever reason (like an intervening
  unwrappable node).  This is unlikely to match user expectations.  There's not
  much we can do about this without entirely revamping text-decoration, so
  we'll have to live with it.

  <li>Currently we don't treat non-underline text-decorations properly, because
  we have no way to set (or cancel) underlines independently of other
  text-decorations from within CSS.  I've sent <a
  href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Mar/0591.html>feedback</a>
  to www-style.

<p>This algorithm implies that we don't support a sublist in the middle of an
item, only at the end.  For instance,

  <pre>&lt;li>foo&lt;ol>...&lt;/ol>bar&lt;/li></pre>

<p>gets transformed to

  <pre>&lt;li>foo&lt;/li>&lt;ol>...&lt;/ol>&lt;li>bar&lt;/li></pre>

<p>which in particular creates an extra list marker for "bar".  This is okay;
we don't need to expose all of HTML's markup abilities through execCommand().
Similarly, the superscript and subscript commands don't allow nesting.  I
didn't see any way to get a sublist in the middle of an item in Word 2007 or in
OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu package, nor in  any browser using just
execCommand(), so it should be no big problem if we require that such nesting
not occur.  (Existing browsers behave weirdly and inconsistently when
confronted with this kind of nesting.)

<p>The reason we need this is that otherwise it gets very confusing to figure out
what happens in cases like trying to outdent
  <pre>&lt;ol>&lt;li>[foo&lt;ol>&lt;li>bar]&lt;/ol>baz&lt;/ol></pre>
<p>If we first normalize, then the natural answer is something like
  <pre>&lt;p>[foo&lt;ol>&lt;li>bar]&lt;li>baz&lt;/ol></pre>
<p>but if we don't, we'd have to special-case in the toggle lists and outdent
algorithms.  This might be worthwhile, but it's not at all clear, and what I
have works okay, so I'll stick with it for now.

<div class=comments>
<p>When querying the value of justify*, IE9 seems to return boolean false
across the board when it doesn't throw exceptions, which it usually does in my
tests.  Chrome 14 dev returns the string "true" or "false" depending on state,
as in other cases, which is useless.  Opera 11.11 returns "" across the board.
Firefox 6.0a2 behaves like with other command values: it returns
"center"/"justify"/"left"/"right" depending on the active range's start node.
Since this is the only behavior that's possibly useful, it's what I specced.
Firefox ties the value closely to the state, returning true for the state if
and only if the value matches the desired value, but this seems less useful
than what I've specced for the state.

<p>This API is based on the four-state text-align of CSS 2.1.  We do some crude
mapping to make it not break too badly with CSS3 values, but it's not going to
work well given the design of the API.
</div>

<p>The <dfn>alignment value</dfn> of a [[node]] <var>node</var> is returned by
the following algorithm:

<p class=note>This is basically like the resolved value of text-align, but with
two key differences.  First, it only ever evaluates to
center/justify/left/right, since that's the model that the justify commands
work with.  Second, it ignores inline elements, because text-align has no
effect on them and their alignment is actually governed by their nearest block
ancestor (if any).

<ol>
  <li>While <var>node</var> is neither null nor an [[element]], or it is an
  [[element]] but its "display" property has [[resval]] "inline" or "none",
  set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>
  <p class=comments>This means there's no applicable style rule, so probably it
  will wind up left-aligned.  Of course this ignores the fact that the
  alignment will really be "start", so this is wrong for RTL, but it's a pretty
  marginal corner case anyway.  (It will only happen if, e.g., everything up to
  and including the html and body elements have display: inline or none.)

  <p>If <var>node</var> is not an [[element]], return "left".

  <li>If <var>node</var>'s "text-align" property has [[resval]] "start",
  return "left" if the [[directionality]] of <var>node</var> is "ltr", "right"
  if it is "rtl".

  <li>If <var>node</var>'s "text-align" property has [[resval]] "end", return
  "right" if the [[directionality]] of <var>node</var> is "ltr", "left" if it
  is "rtl".

  <li>If <var>node</var>'s "text-align" property has [[resval]] "center",
  "justify", "left", or "right", return that value.

  <li>Return "left".
</ol>

<p class=note>Sometimes one location corresponds to multiple distinct boundary
points.  For instance, in the DOM {{code|<p>Hello</p>}}, a boundary point might
lie at the beginning of the text node or the beginning of the element node, but
these don't logically differ much and will appear the same to the user, so we
often want to treat them the same.  The algorithms here allow navigating
through such equivalent boundary points, for when we want to make the selection
as inclusive or exclusive as possible.  For deletion, we want to delete as few
nodes as possible, so we move the start node forward and the end node backward.
In other cases we might do the reverse, expanding the selection.  In still
other cases we might want to move forward or backward to try getting to a text
node.

<p>Given a [[boundarypoint]] (<var>node</var>, <var>offset</var>), the
<dfn>next equivalent point</dfn> is either a [[boundarypoint]] or null, as
returned by the following algorithm:

<ol>
  <li>If <var>node</var>'s [[length]] is zero, return null.

  <li class=note>We don't want to move into or out of zero-length nodes,
  because that would move us straight through them.  For instance, if
  {{code|{}<span></span>}} were equivalent to {{code|<span>{}</span>}}, it
  would also be equivalent to {{code|<span></span>{} }}.  This produces very
  unexpected results for nodes like {{code|<br>}}.

  <li>If <var>offset</var> is <var>node</var>'s [[length]], and
  <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is not null, and <var>node</var> is an
  <span>inline node</span>, return (<var>node</var>'s [[parent]], 1 +
  <var>node</var>'s [[index]]).

  <li class=note>For instance, {{code|<span>foo[]</span>}} is equivalent to
  {{code|<span>foo{}</span>}}, which is equivalent to {{code|<span>foo</span>{}
  }}.  However, {{code|<p>foo{}</p>}} is <em>not</em> equivalent to
  {{code|<p>foo</p>{} }} &ndash; the cursor might look like it's in a visibly
  different position.

  <li>If <var>node</var> has a [[child]] with [[index]] <var>offset</var>,
  and that [[child]]'s [[length]] is not zero, and that [[child]] is an
  <span>inline node</span>, return (that [[child]], 0).

  <li class=note>For instance, {{code|{}<span>foo</span>}} is equivalent to
  {{code|<span>{}foo</span>}}, which is equivalent to
  {{code|<span>[]foo</span>}}.  As noted before, though, we don't descend into
  empty nodes.  And again, {{code|{}<p>foo</p>}} is different from
  {{code|<p>{}foo</p>}}.

  <li>Return null.
</ol>

<p>Given a [[boundarypoint]] (<var>node</var>, <var>offset</var>), the
<dfn>previous equivalent point</dfn> is either a [[boundarypoint]] or null, as

  <li>If <var>node</var>'s [[length]] is zero, return null.

  <li>If <var>offset</var> is 0, and <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is not null,
  and <var>node</var> is an <span>inline node</span>, return (<var>node</var>'s

  &minus; 1, and that [[child]]'s [[length]] is not zero, and that [[child]] is

<p>A [[boundarypoint]] (<var>node</var>, <var>offset</var>) is a <dfn>block
start point</dfn> if either <var>node</var>'s [[parent]] is null and
<var>offset</var> is zero; or <var>node</var> has a [[child]] with [[index]]
<var>offset</var> &minus; 1, and that [[child]] is either a
<span>visible</span> <span>block node</span> or a <span>visible</span> [[br]].

<p>A [[boundarypoint]] (<var>node</var>, <var>offset</var>) is a <dfn>block end

[[child]] with [[index]] <var>offset</var>, and that [[child]] is a

<p>A [[boundarypoint]] is a <dfn>block boundary point</dfn> if it is either a
<span>block start point</span> or a <span>block end point</span>.

<p>When a user agent is to <dfn>block-extend</dfn> a [[range]]
<var>range</var>, it must run the following steps:

<div class=note>
<p>Generally, block commands work on any block that contains part of the
selection, even if the selection doesn't include the whole block.  This
algorithm takes an input range, copies it, stretches out the copy to contain
entire blocks, and returns the result.  Then the caller will normally use it
instead of the range it started with.  For instance, if the cursor is collapsed
in a text node inside a paragraph, this will generally return a range that
includes the whole paragraph.

<p>Two bits of magic worth noting.  First, <code title>&lt;br></code> counts as
a block delimiter here, since it looks the same as a block boundary (assuming
no margin etc.) and this is a visual API.  We include the <code
title>&lt;br></code> as part of the line that precedes it.  Second, if the
selection is inside an <code title>&lt;li></code>, this will extend it to
include the whole <code title>&lt;li></code>.  This latter point is weird, and
I should re-examine it sometime, but it seems to work.

<h3>Recording and restoring overrides</h3>
<!--@{-->

<p>To <dfn>record current overrides</dfn>:

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>overrides</var> be a list of (string, string or boolean) ordered
  pairs, initially empty.

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>When restoring, some commands can interfere with others.  Specifically, we
  want to restore createLink before foreColor and underline, and subscript and
  superscript before fontSize.  TODO: This approach only works for default
  styles (although I'm not sure offhand how we could handle non-default styles
  in principle).

  <p>Firefox 7.0a2 and Opera 11.50 don't honor createLink with collapsed
  selections.  If you insert text, it's not linked.  The spec follows Chrome 14
  dev.  IE9 also ignores createLink with collapsed selections, but its behavior
  in other cases for collapsed selections is totally different from all other
  browsers, so it's not a fair comparison.
  </div>

  <p>If there is a <span>value override</span> for "createLink", add
  ("createLink", <span>value override</span> for "createLink") to
  <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments> Firefox 7.0a2 and Opera 11.50 will honor repeated
  subscript/superscript commands on a collapsed selection, allowing you to nest
  them.  The spec follows the general philosophy that we don't allow users to
  nest subscript/superscript, so the last one wins.  Chrome 14 dev is similar
  to the spec.

  <p>For each <var>command</var> in the list "bold", "italic",
  "strikethrough", "subscript", "superscript", "underline", in order: if there
  is a <span>state override</span> for <var>command</var>, add
  (<var>command</var>, <var>command</var>'s <span>state override</span>) to
  <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>For each <var>command</var> in the list "fontName", "fontSize",
  "foreColor", "hiliteColor", in order: if there is a <span>value
  override</span> for <var>command</var>, add (<var>command</var>,
  <var>command</var>'s <span>value override</span>) to <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>Return <var>overrides</var>.
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>record current states and values</dfn>:

<ol>
  <li>Let <var>overrides</var> be a list of (string, string or boolean) ordered
  pairs, initially empty.

  <li>Let <var>node</var> be the first <span>formattable node</span>
  <span>effectively contained</span> in the <span>active range</span>, or null
  if there is none.

  <li>If <var>node</var> is null, return <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>Add ("createLink", <var>node</var>'s <span>effective command value</span>
  for "createLink") to <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Thus we will set state overrides based on the first
  formattable node, to match values.  This means that if you have
  {{code|<p>foo<b>[bar</b>baz]</p>}} and hit backspace and hit A, you'll get
  {{code|<p>foo<b>a[]</b></p>}}, although bold was previously indeterminate.
  This is needed to match the behavior of hitting A straight away, since
  innerText doesn't strip wrappers when it invokes "delete the contents".

  <p>For each <var>command</var> in the list "bold", "italic",
  "strikethrough", "subscript", "superscript", "underline", in order: if
  <var>node</var>'s <span>effective command value</span> for <var>command</var>
  is one of its <span>inline command activated values</span>, add
  (<var>command</var>, true) to <var>overrides</var>, and otherwise add
  (<var>command</var>, false) to <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>For each <var>command</var> in the list "fontName", "foreColor",
  "hiliteColor", in order: add (<var>command</var>, <var>command</var>'s
  <span>value</span>) to <var>overrides</var>.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Special case for fontSize, because its values are weird.

  <p>Add ("fontSize", <var>node</var>'s <span>effective command value</span>
  for "fontSize") to <var>overrides</var>.

  <p class=XXX>This is wrong: it will convert non-pixel sizes to pixel sizes.
  But I don't see any way to avoid it.  Hopefully it won't come up too often.
  font-size is a real problem, because the mapping from specified value to
  computed value is lossy and not fully defined (e.g., how many px is
  "small"?).

  <li>Return <var>overrides</var>.
</ol>

<p>To <dfn>restore states and values</dfn> specified by a list

<h3>Deleting the selection</h3>
<!-- @{ -->

<p class=comments>TODO: Consider what should happen for block merging in corner
cases like display: inline-table.

<p>To <dfn>delete the selection</dfn>, given a <var>block merging</var> flag
that defaults to true, a <var>strip wrappers</var> flag that defaults to
true, and a string <var>direction</var> that defaults to "forward":

<div class=note>
<p>The idea behind this algorithm is self-explanatory, but the details wind up
being remarkably complicated.

<p>First, any editable nodes inside the selection will be deleted, and the
selection will be collapsed.  By way of contrast, <span>effectively
contained</span> tries to expand the range to include as much as possible, so
{{code|<p>[foo]</p>}} contains the {{code|<p>}}.  What we do here is contract
the range to include as little as possible, so {{code|{<p>foo</p>} }} contains
only {{code|foo}} and doesn't delete the paragraph.

<p>After that, if the selection originally started and ended in different
blocks, and the <var>block merging</var> flag is true, the end block will get
merged into the start block.  This is needed so if the user selects text on
several lines and deletes it, the text immediately that was before the
selection winds up on the same line as the text immediately after it.  For
example, {{code|<p>fo[o</p><div>b]ar</div>}} becomes {{code|<p>fo[]ar</p>}}.
This procedure winds up being tricky, and takes up a large chunk of the logic.

<p>Tables are a notable special case.  If an entire table is contained in the
range, it will be deleted.  If it's anything less, only the contents of the
cells will be deleted and the table structure will be left intact.

<p>The <var>strip wrappers</var> flag controls what happens if the deletion
removes all the contents of an inline element.  If wrappers are being stripped,
the empty inline element will be removed: this is usually what you want,
because the user can't position the selection inside it.  But callers like
<span>the <code title>insertText</code> command</span> that intend to
immediately insert new contents want to leave the wrappers, so the new contents
are wrapped by the same thing as the old.

<p>Even if <var>strip wrappers</var> is true, the algorithm will set a
<span>state override</span> and <span>value override</span> for any styles it
winds up removing.  This way, if the user deletes a wrapper that adds a style
(or link for that matter), then types something, the new text will get the
style from the old text.

    <li>Otherwise, call [[collapsetoend]] on the [[contextobject]]'s
    [[selection]].

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>If <var>start node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>start offset</var>
  is 0, set <var>start offset</var> to the [[index]] of <var>start node</var>,
  then set <var>start node</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>If <var>end node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>end offset</var> is
  its [[length]], set <var>end offset</var> to one plus the [[index]] of
  <var>end node</var>, then set <var>end node</var> to its [[parent]].

  <p class=note>The previous two steps are so that we won't leave empty text
  nodes anywhere.

  <li>Call [[selcollapse|<var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>]] on
  the [[contextobject]]'s [[selection]].

  <li>Call [[extend|<var>end node</var>, <var>end offset</var>]] on the
  [[contextobject]]'s [[selection]].

  <li class=note>
  <p>When we delete a selection that spans multiple blocks, we merge the end
  block's contents into the start block, like

<pre>{{html|
<p>fo[o</p><pre>b]ar</pre>
-> <p>fo[]ar</p>.}}</pre>

  <p>We figure out what the start and end blocks are before we start deleting
  anything.

  <li>Let <var>start block</var> be the <span>active range</span>'s
  [[startnode]].

  <li>While <var>start block</var>'s [[parent]] is <span>in the same editing
  host</span> and <var>start block</var> is an <span>inline node</span>, set
  <var>start block</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>We only merge to or from block nodes or editing hosts.  (This is just in
  case someone makes a span into an editing host and sticks paragraphs inside
  it or something . . . we could probably drop that proviso.)  Firefox 7.0a2
  ignores the display property when merging, so it doesn't merge {{code|<span
  style=display:block>}} but does merge {{code|<p style=display:inline>}}.
  This is undesirable, because it's visually wrong.  IE10PP2 and Chrome 14 dev
  behave more like the spec, and Opera 11.50 seems to be unable to make up its
  mind.

  <p>If span isn't an allowed child, it's probably something unpleasant like a
  table row or a list or such.  We don't want to merge to or from something
  like that, because we'd most likely wind up with the wrong type of child
  somewhere.  It should be pretty hard for this to happen given the
  normalization we do on the selection; I'm not actually sure how it could
  happen at all, actually, unless you start out with a DOM that has non-allowed
  children someplace.  So it's basically a sanity check.

  <p>We don't let either start block or end block be a td or th.  This means
  we'll never merge to or from a td or th.  This matches Firefox 5.0a2, and
  reportedly Word as well.  Chrome 13 dev and Opera 11.11 allow merging from a
  non-table cell end block to a table cell start block, but not vice versa.  In
  IE9 the delete key just does nothing.
  </div>

  <p>If <var>start block</var> is neither a <span>block node</span> nor an
  <span>editing host</span>, or "span" is not an <span>allowed child</span> of
  <var>start block</var>, or <var>start block</var> is a [[td]] or [[th]], set
  <var>start block</var> to null.

  <li>Let <var>end block</var> be the <span>active range</span>'s [[endnode]].

  <li>While <var>end block</var>'s [[parent]] is <span>in the same editing
  host</span> and <var>end block</var> is an <span>inline node</span>, set
  <var>end block</var> to its [[parent]].

  <li>If <var>end block</var> is neither a <span>block node</span> nor an
  <span>editing host</span>, or "span" is not an <span>allowed child</span> of
  <var>end block</var>, or <var>end block</var> is a [[td]] or [[th]], set
  <var>end block</var> to null.

  <li class=note>
  <p>Later on we'll restore <var>overrides</var>.  This ensures that
  if we delete inline formatting elements and the user then types something,
  the typed text will have the same style as before.

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>As far as I can tell, IE9 and Opera 11.50 don't do this at all.  If you
  delete a selection and then start typing, the new text doesn't take on the
  styles of the old text.

  <p>Firefox 7.0a2 seems to do it for some styles but not others.
  Strikethrough, superscript, subscript, and links seem to be lost, at a
  minimum.

  <p>The spec goes with something like Chrome 14 dev, which tries to preserve lots

  <li>If <var>start node</var> is an <span>editable</span> [[text]] node, call

  <p class=comments>IE9 doesn't seem to let you do any intercell deletions: the
  delete key does nothing if you select across multiple cells.  Firefox 5.0a2
  and Opera 11.11 behave as the spec says, not removing any table things.
  Chrome 13 dev will remove entire rows if selected.  Note that IE, Firefox,
  Word 2007, and OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu all switch to a magic
  cell-selection mode when you try to select between cells, at least in some
  cases, instead of selecting letter-by-letter.

  <p>For each <var>node</var> [[contained]] in the <span>active range</span>,
  append <var>node</var> to <var>node list</var> if the last member of

  <var>node</var> is <span>editable</span>; and <var>node</var> is not a
  [[thead]], [[tbody]], [[tfoot]], [[tr]], [[th]], or [[td]].

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>parent</var> be the [[parent]] of <var>node</var>.

    <li>Remove <var>node</var> from <var>parent</var>.

    <li>
    <p class=comments>Do this before stripping wrappers: see <a
    href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13831>bug 13831</a>.

    <p>If the <span>block node of</span> <var>parent</var> has no
    <span>visible</span> [[children]], and <var>parent</var> is
    <span>editable</span> or an <span>editing host</span>, call
    [[createelement|"br"]] on the [[contextobject]] and append the result as
    the last [[child]] of <var>parent</var>.

    <li>
    <p class=comments>Taking insertText to test the case where strip wrappers
    is false, with value a: {{code<|p>[foo<b>bar</b>]baz}} becomes
    {{code|<p>a[]baz}} per spec, in IE9, and in Chrome 14 dev.  Firefox 7.0a2
    and Opera 11.50 make it {{code<|p>a[]<b></b>baz}}, with a useless wrapper.
    {{code<|p>foo<b>[bar</b>baz]}} becomes {{code<|p>foo<b>a[]</b>}} per spec
    and in IE9 and Firefox 7.0a2 and Opera 11.50; in Chrome 14 dev apparently
    it initially becomes {{code|<p>fooa[]}}, but then the style is recreated.
    This is detectable if you do something weird like {{code<|span
    style=color:#aBcDeF>}} instead of {{code<|b>}}: it comes {{code<|font
    class=Apple-style-span color=#abcdef>}} or such.  I follow IE9 in all
    cases, because it makes the most sense.

    <p>If <var>strip wrappers</var> is true or <var>parent</var> is not an
    [[inclusiveancestor]] of <var>start node</var>, while <var>parent</var> is
    an <span>editable</span> <span>inline node</span> with [[length]] 0,
    let <var>grandparent</var> be the [[parent]] of <var>parent</var>, then
    remove <var>parent</var> from <var>grandparent</var>, then set
    <var>parent</var> to <var>grandparent</var>.

    <p class=note>Even if <var>strip wrappers</var> is false, we still want to
    strip wrappers that aren't [[inclusiveancestors]] of <var>start node</var>.
    The idea of not stripping wrappers is that we're going to insert new
    content right afterward, like text or an image, but that new content will
    be inserted at the start node.  Wrappers in other places still need to be
    removed, because they would otherwise remain empty.

<h3>Splitting a node list's parent</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p>To <dfn>split the parent</dfn> of a list <var>node list</var> of consecutive
[[sibling]] [[nodes]]:

<div class=note>
<p>This algorithm breaks up the parent of <var>node list</var>.  If they're the
only children of their parent, the parent is removed entirely.  If there are
preceding or following siblings, the original parent is left intact as the
parent of those siblings.  If there are both preceding and following siblings,
the original parent is left as the parent of the following siblings and a clone
is used for the parent of the preceding siblings.

<p>We make sure not to disrupt the appearance any more than necessary.
Obviously margins or such on the parent will be lost, but the children will not
wind up on the same line as anything they weren't already on the same line as.
E.g., if we split the parent of "bar" in <code
title>foo&lt;p>bar&lt;/p></code>, we get <code title>foo&lt;br>bar</code>, not
<code title>foobar</code>.  (This is amazingly complicated and error-prone.)
We don't preserve inline styles: callers that want to do that should call
<span>record the values</span> and <span>restore the values</span> themselves.

<p>All this is useful in a lot of situations, like for outdenting.  For inline
formatting commands, we almost always rely on <span title="push down
values">pushing down values</span> instead, since that often leads to tidier
markup.
</div>

<ol>

<h3>Canonical space sequences</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=note>
<p>Whitespace in HTML normally collapses.  However, if the user hits the space
bar twice in an HTML editor, they expect to see two spaces, not one.  Even if
they hit the space bar once at the beginning or end of a line, it would
collapse without special handling.  The only good solution here is for the
author to set white-space: pre-wrap on the editable area, and on everywhere the
content is reproduced.  But if they don't, we have to painfully hack around the
problem.

<p>This is a basically intractable problem because of the unfortunate
confluence of three factors.  One, our characters are Unicode, and Unicode
doesn't know about whitespace collapsing, so it provides no special characters
to control it.  Two, HTML itself provides no features that control whitespace
collapsing without undesired side effects (like inhibiting line breaks or not
being allowed inside <code title>&lt;p></code>).  Three, we need to support
user agents that don't reliably support CSS, since that includes many popular
mail clients.

<p>The upshot is we have no good way to control whitespace collapse, so we rely
on the least bad way available: <code title>&amp;nbsp;</code>.  This doesn't
collapse with adjacent whitespace in browsers, which is good.  But it also
doesn't allow a line break opportunity, which is bad.  In any run of whitespace
that we don't want to collapse, any two regular spaces must be separated by an
<code title>&amp;nbsp;</code> so they don't collapse together, but we need to
carefully limit runs of consecutive <code title>&amp;nbsp;</code>s to minimize
the damage to line-breaking behavior.

<p>The result is an elaborate and meticulously-crafted hodgepodge of bad
compromises that frankly isn't worth the effort to explain here.  The saving
grace is that it all gets disabled if white-space is set to pre-wrap as it
should be, so authors can opt out of the insanity.  Interested readers will
find detailed rationale for the exact sequences required in the comments.

<h3>Indenting and outdenting</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=note>
<p>There are two basically different types of indent/outdent: lists, and
everything else.  For lists we'll wrap the item in a nested list to indent, and
<span title="split the parent">split its parent</span> to outdent.  For
everything else we'll wrap in a <code title>&lt;blockquote></code> to indent,
and try breaking it out of an ancestor <span>indentation element</span> to
outdent.

<p>Indenting winds up being pretty simple: just add an appropriate wrapper.
There's not really anything to think about here except which wrapper we want
(<code title>&lt;ol></code> or <code title>&lt;ul></code> or <code
title>&lt;blockquote></code>), and establishing that is not rocket science.

<p>Outdenting is considerably more complicated.  The basic idea we follow is to
first find the nearest editable ancestor that's a list or <span>indentation
element</span>.  If we succeed, and the node we're trying to outdent is the
only descendant of the ancestor, of course we can just remove the ancestor and
that's that.  Otherwise, what we do is remove the ancestor and then indent all
its other descendants, much like <span title="push down values">pushing down
values</span>.

<p>But of course, there are complications.  We don't always actually want to
remove the <em>closest</em> ancestor that's causing indentation.  For one
thing, we prefer ancestors that we can remove completely, i.e., <span
title="simple indentation element">simple indentation elements</span>.  When
outdenting <code title>&lt;blockquote>&lt;blockquote
id="abc">foo&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/blockquote></code>, removing the inner tag
would result in <code title>&lt;blockquote>&lt;div
id="abc">foo&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote></code>, since we don't want to lose the
id.  Thus we prefer to remove the outer tag and wind up with <code
title>&lt;blockquote id="abc">foo&lt;/blockquote></code>.

<p>Also, if the node we're outdenting is itself a list, we prefer to remove an
ancestor <span>indentation element</span> rather than the list.  Otherwise, if
the user selected some text, indented it, then added a list, there would be no
way to remove the indentation without removing the list first.  This way, the
user could remove the list with the appropriate list-toggling command or remove
the indentation with the outdent command.
</div>

<div class=comments>
<p>We have to handle entire lists of siblings at once, or else we'd wind up
doing something like

<pre>&lt;ol>
  {&lt;li>foo&lt;/li>
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>bar&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>}
&lt;/ol>
->
&lt;ol>&lt;ol>
  &lt;li>foo&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>bar&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>&lt;/ol>
->
&lt;ol>&lt;ol>&lt;ol>
  &lt;li>foo&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>bar&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>&lt;/ol>&lt;/ol></pre>

<p>since by the time we got to doing the &lt;ol> that originally contained
"bar", we won't remember that we aren't supposed to indent "foo" a second time.
</div>

<p>To <dfn>indent</dfn> a list <var>node list</var> of consecutive [[sibling]]
[[nodes]]:

<ol>
  <li>If <var>node list</var> is empty, do nothing and abort these steps.

  <li>Let <var>first node</var> be the first member of <var>node list</var>.

  <li>If <var>first node</var>'s [[parent]] is an [[ol]] or [[ul]]:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>tag</var> be the [[localname]] of the [[parent]] of
    <var>first node</var>.

    <li>
    <div class=comments>
    <p>This matches IE9, Firefox 4.0, and Chrome 12 dev.  If there's a
    preceding &lt;li>, Opera 11.10 instead adds the new parent to the end of
    that &lt;li>, so it's not the child of another list, which is invalid.  But
    the other browsers' way of doing things makes things simpler.  E.g., if we
    want to indent an &lt;li> and it has &lt;ol>/&lt;ul> children, we have to
    distinguish between the case where we want to indent the whole &lt;li> or
    only the first part.  It also allows things like

<pre>
&lt;ol>&lt;li>
  foo
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>bar&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>
  baz
&lt;/li>&lt;/ol></pre>

    <p>in which case it's unclear what we should do if the user selects "foo" and
    indents.  I've filed <a
    href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12609>a bug</a> on
    HTML5.

    <p><span>Wrap</span> <var>node list</var>, with <var>sibling criteria</var>

    <var>tag</var> and false otherwise, and <var>new parent
    instructions</var> returning the result of calling
    [[createelement|<var>tag</var>]] on the [[ownerdocument]] of <var>first
    node</var>.

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>Firefox 4.0 respects the CSS styling flag for indent, but Chrome 12 dev
  does not.  I always produce blockquotes, even if CSS styling is on, for two
  reasons.  One, IE9 handles inline margin attributes badly: when outdenting,
  it propagates the margin to the parent, which doesn't actually remove it.
  Two, in CSS mode I'd want to use &lt;div style="margin: 1em 40px"> to match
  non-CSS mode, but authors are very likely to want to remove the top/bottom
  margin, which they can't do if it's not a special tag.  Authors who really
  want divs for indentation could always convert the blockquotes to divs
  themselves.  But if people really want it, I could respect CSS styling mode
  here too.

  <p>The top/bottom margins might be undesirable here, but no more so than for
  &lt;ol>/&lt;ul>/&lt;p>/etc.  Here as there, authors can remove them with CSS
  if they want.

  <p>blockquote indents on both sides, so we don't have to worry about
  directionality.  In theory it would be better if we indented only on the
  start side, but that requires care to get right in mixed-direction cases.
  Even once browsers start to support margin-start and so on, we can't use them
  because a) we have to work okay in legacy browsers and b) it doesn't help if
  a descendant block has different direction (so should be indented the other
  way).  So let's not worry about it: most browsers don't, and the ones that do
  get it wrong.  Just indent on both sides.

<div class=comments>
<p>Things that are produced for indentation that we need to consider removing:

<ul>
  <li>Plain &lt;blockquote> (produced by spec, Firefox 4.0 non-CSS, Opera
  11.00)

  <li>&lt;blockquote style="margin-right: 0" dir="ltr"> and &lt;blockquote
  style="margin-left: 0" dir="rtl"> (IE9)

  <li>&lt;blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0
  40px; border: none; padding: 0px"> (Chrome 12 dev)

  <li>&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px"> and &lt;div style="margin-right:
  40px"> (Firefox 4.0 CSS if no other element available)

  <li>Other random things with display: block whose left or right margin was
  increased by 40px (Firefox 4.0 CSS)
</ul>

<p>For discussion on the list-related stuff, see the comment for
<a href=#the-insertorderedlist-command>insertOrderedList</a>.

<p>Gecko in CSS mode just adds margin properties to random elements that are
lying around.  We don't attempt to remove those, because 1) the amount and
position of the margin can vary (it increases the margin if there's a
preexisting one), so it's potentially complicated, and 2) no browser removes
such margins on outdent, including Gecko, except for Gecko in CSS mode.  TODO:
Consider removing it anyway.
</div>

<p>To <dfn>outdent</dfn> a [[node]] <var>node</var>:

<ol>
  <li>If <var>node</var> is not <span>editable</span>, abort these steps.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>The easy case is when the whole element is indented.  In
  this case we remove the whole thing indiscriminately.  In the case of
  blockquotes created by IE, this might change the direction of some children,
  but then their direction was probably changed incorrectly in the first place,
  so no harm.

  <p>If <var>node</var> is a <span>simple indentation element</span>, remove
  <var>node</var>, <span>preserving its descendants</span>.  Then abort these
  steps.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>This might be a simple indentation element that had style
  added to it by Firefox in CSS mode, for instance (color, font-family, etc.).

  <p>If <var>node</var> is an <span>indentation element</span>:

  <ol>
    <li>Unset the <code data-anolis-spec=html title="the dir
    attribute">dir</code> attribute of <var>node</var>, if any.

    <li>Unset the margin, padding, and border CSS properties of
    <var>node</var>.

    <li><span>Set the tag name</span> of <var>node</var> to "div".

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>Approximate algorithms when an ancestor is causing the indentation appear
  to be:

  <dl>
    <dt>IE9
    <dd>Go to the innermost element causing indentation.  If the stuff to be
    outdented includes all the contents of that element, get rid of it, but if
    it has any attributes, change it to a &lt;p> with those same attributes.  This
    is an excellent idea in general, but unfortunately it preserves
    explicitly-specified margins in style attributes, which isn't great.  In
    other cases, it moves the stuff to be outdented outside.  Not clear on
    all the details, seems to be pretty confusing.  Also does a bunch of
    seemingly arbitrary normalization like removing divs and some attributes
    from some things . . .

    <dt>Firefox 4.0
    <dd>Go to the innermost element causing indentation.  If the stuff to be
    outdented includes all the contents of that element, get rid of it, even if
    it has arbitrary attributes.  Otherwise, move the stuff to be outdented
    outside the indenting element.  If there are any intervening elements that
    include stuff not to be outdented, wrap the outdented stuff in copies
    (which can duplicate id's, etc.).

    <dt>Chrome 12 dev
    <dd>Go to the outermost element causing indentation (even if the current
    element is itself causing indentation).  Move the text to be outdented
    outside that outermost element, without regard to any intervening elements.
    Then recreate the original styles on the moved text, in some fashion.
    Something like that; it confuses me and doesn't seem to be reasonable.

    <dt>Opera 11.00
    <dd>Like Firefox, except it goes to the outermost element, not the
    innermost.  Also seems to special-case to avoid duplicate id's, and has a
    few other quirks.
  </dl>

  <p>Overall, all flawed, so I'll make up my own, patterned after pushing down
  styles.  First we search ancestors for a simple indentation element, which we
  stand a chance of completely removing.  Failing that, we look for an
  indentation element that's not simple, so we can't completely remove it.
  </div>

  <p>Let <var>current ancestor</var> be <var>node</var>'s [[parent]].

  <li>Let <var>ancestor list</var> be a list of [[nodes]], initially empty.

  <li>While <var>current ancestor</var> is an <span>editable</span> [[element]]
  that is neither a <span>simple indentation element</span> nor an [[ol]] nor a

  </ol>

  <li>
  <p class=comments>When asked to outdent a list wrapped in a simple

  remove the simple indentation element, as does the spec.

<h3>Toggling lists</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=note>
<p>This is the action for <span>the <code title>insertOrderedList</code>
command</span> and <span>the <code title>insertUnorderedList</code>
command</span>, which behave identically except for which list type they
target.  It does several things that vary contextually.

<p>If everything in the selection is contained in the target list type already,
this more or less just outdents everything one step.  This is relatively
simple.

<p>Otherwise, it's slightly more complicated:

<p>First, any lists of the opposite list type (<var>other tag name</var>) get
converted to the target list type (<var>tag name</var>).  They get merged into
a sibling if appropriate, otherwise we <span>set the tag name</span>.

<p>Then we go through all the affected nodes, handling each run of consecutive
siblings separately.  Any line that's not already wrapped in an <code
title>&lt;li></code> gets wrapped.  If the parent at this point isn't a list at
all, the run gets wrapped in a list.  If it's the wrong type of list, we
<span>split the parent</span> and rewrap it in the right type of list.  That's
basically it, except that we have to exercise the usual care to try merging
with siblings and so forth.

<div class=comments>
<p>Research for insertOrderedList/insertUnorderedList: tested the following
command sequences in IE9, Firefox 4.0, Chrome 12 dev, Opera 11.10,
OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu package, Microsoft Office Word 2007.  The commands
"ol", "ul", "indent", "outdent" correspond in browsers to "insertOrderedList",
"insertUnorderedList", "indent", and "outdent"; in OO.org to "Numbering
On/Off", "Bullets On/Off", "Increase Indent", "Decrease Indent"; and in Word to
"Numbering", "Bullets", "Increase Indent", "Decrease Indent".

<p>Note: OO has a bunch of extra options, like "Promote One Level", "Demote One
Level", "Promote One Level With Subpoints", "Demote One Level With Subpoints",
"Insert Unnumbered Entry", "Restart Numbering".  The regular "Increase/Decrease
Indent" commands work oddly, and I assume they're not really meant to be used
inside lists.  Thus I also tested with "Promote One Level" and "Demote One
Level".  These are denoted by OO' instead of OO.

<p>Assume that there are style rules in effect like

<pre>
ol ol { list-style-type: lower-alpha }
ol ol ol { list-style-type: lower-roman }</pre>

<p>This is the default appearance in Word, and I set OO to something similar
with Bullets and Numbering &rarr; Outline in the list editing toolbox.  I'm
ignoring bullet style throughout, for no particular reason.

<p>Ignoring the conceptual model of HTML, which users won't understand, here's
the conceptual model I've developed for lists: text is divided up into blocks.
Each block has an indentation level and a list marker type.  The list marker
type can be either nothing, ordered, or unordered.  A list block cannot have
indentation level less than one.  Any given piece of text is part of only one
block.  A block may be visually non-contiguous, such as if a single list block
is interrupted by a further-indented block.

<p>To find the right number (or letter) for an ordered-list block, look at the
immediately preceding block, but skip over any blocks of higher indentation
level.  If there is no immediately preceding block, or it's not an ordered-list
block, or it has a lower indentation level, the number is 1 (or a, i, etc.).
Otherwise, it's the number of the preceding block plus one.

<p>ol/ul commands change the selected block to that list marker type, or remove
the list marker type if it's already the chosen type.  If the block has
indentation level zero, it increases to one.

<p>indent/outdent commands change the selected block's indentation level.  If a
list block's indentation level is reduced to zero, it's converted to a regular
block.

<p>What this means from an HTML perspective, roughly:

<ul>
  <li>A list block is the entire contents of an &lt;li> element, ignoring any nested
  list elements or indentation elements.  A non-list block is a line box.

  <li>Indentation level is equal to the number of ancestor elements that are either
  &lt;li>s or indentation elements (blockquotes or indenting divs).

  <li>To find the list marker type, go to the first ancestor that's either an &lt;li>
  or indentation element.

  <li>Correct numbering should automatically follow from the way &lt;ol> works in HTML
  (which is one of the reasons I use this model).

  <li>An ol command in an ordered-list block removes the surrounding &lt;li>,
  migrating its contents into the parent of the &lt;ol>.  This splits up the &lt;ol> if
  it's not the first or last child, and wraps the contents in a new &lt;li> if
  necessary.  If there's another list or indentation element nested in the &lt;li>
  we're removing, it will get re-wrapped in a new &lt;ol>, outside the
  newly-created &lt;li>, so that it maintains its indentation.  This might cause
  the new &lt;li> to wind up in multiple pieces, if the original block was not
  contiguous, which means the non-contiguous block is split into several blocks
  (with different numbers).

  <li>An ol command in an unordered-list block breaks up the parent &lt;ul> and puts a
  new &lt;ol> in between the two pieces, moving the parent &lt;li> into it.  If the
  &lt;li> was the first or last child, we merge with an existing adjacent &lt;ol> if
  possible.  All children stay as they are.

  <li>An ol command in a non-list block with indentation zero wraps it in a new
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>, or merges with an adjacent &lt;ol> if possible.

  <li>An ol command in a non-list block with nonzero indentation converts the
  parent to an &lt;ol>&lt;li>, breaking it up if necessary.

  <li>The ul command works similarly to ol.

  <li>indent in a non-list block wraps in an indentation element.  In a list block,
  it wraps the &lt;li> in an extra &lt;ol> or &lt;ul> as appropriate.  With merging.
  Whatever.  Let me just write the spec.

  <li>outdent in a non-list block strips an indentation element, if one is present.
  In a list block, it breaks apart the parent &lt;ol> or &lt;ul> and makes the
  affected block a sibling in between the newly-split list elements.  Will
  create new &lt;li>s, etc. etc.
</ul>

<p>Sheesh, lists are complicated.

<h3>Justifying the selection</h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=note>This is the <span>action</span> for the four <code
title>justify*</code> commands.  It's pretty straightforward, with no notable
gotchas or special cases.  It works more or less like a stripped-down version
of <span>set the selection's value</span>, except it gets to be much simpler
because it's much less general.  (It's not similar enough to just invoke that
algorithm: too many things differ between block and inline elements.)

<div class=comments>
<p>There are two basic ways this works in browsers: using the align attribute,
and using CSS text-align.  IE9 and Opera 11.11 use only the align attribute,
Chrome 13 dev uses only text-align, and Firefox 5.0a2 varies based on
styleWithCSS.  The two ways produce entirely different results, which is a real
problem, so I don't think Firefox's approach is tenable.  text-align is more
valid, and for typical contenteditable cases it works the same.  But for cases
where you have fixed-width blocks, like tables or just divs with a width set,
it behaves differently, and in those cases the align attribute is more useful.

<p>TODO: text-align doesn't behave as expected if there are descendant blocks
with non-100% width, like tables.  The align attribute behaves a lot more
nicely in such cases, but it's not valid.  Not clear what to do.  For now I've
stuck with text-align, just because the cases where it misbehaves can't be
created by any sequence of stock execCommand()s that I know of, but this needs
more careful consideration.  Gecko in CSS mode seems to special-case tables,
adding auto margins to the table element to get it to align correctly.

<p>TODO: We could do something along the lines of pushing down values here,
although no browser does.  In fact, it's very likely this can be rewritten in
terms of the inline formatting command primitives, but it's not clear if it
would be worth the added complexity.
</div>

<p>To <dfn>justify the selection</dfn> to a string <var>alignment</var> (either

  <li><span>Block-extend</span> the <span>active range</span>, and let <var>new

  <li>
  <p class=comments>No browser actually removes center, but it makes sense to
  do so.

  <p>Let <var>element list</var> be a list of all <span>editable</span>
  [[element]]s [[contained]] in <var>new range</var> that either has an
  attribute in the [[htmlnamespace]] whose [[attrlocalname]] is "align", or has
  a [[style]] attribute that sets "text-align", or is a <code

  <li>For each <var>element</var> in <var>element list</var>:

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>element</var> has an attribute in the [[htmlnamespace]] whose
    [[attrlocalname]] is "align", remove that attribute.

    <li>Unset the CSS property "text-align" on <var>element</var>, if it's set
    by a [[style]] attribute.

    <li>If <var>element</var> is a [[div]] or [[span]] or <code

  <li>
  <p class=comments>This could theoretically be necessary, like if it converted

  <p><span>Block-extend</span> the <span>active range</span>, and let <var>new

  <li>Let <var>node list</var> be a list of [[nodes]], initially empty.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Of tested browsers, only Chrome 13 dev seems to not apply
  the alignment to nodes that are already aligned.  Even then, it does apply it
  if the alignment is just inherited from the root.

    </ul>

    <p class=comments>As with inline formatting, I only ever create new
    elements, and don't ever modify existing ones.  This doesn't match how any

<h3><dfn>The <code title>delete</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=note>
<p>This is the same as hitting backspace (see <a
href=#additional-requirements>Additional requirements</a>).  The easy part is
if the selection isn't collapsed: just <span>delete the selection</span>.  But
it turns out rich-text editors have a lot of special behaviors for hitting
backspace with a collapsed selection.  Most obviously, if there's a text node
right before the cursor (maybe wrapped in some inline elements), we delete its
last character.  But some of the special cases we run into are:

<ul>
  <li><span>Invisible</span> nodes are removed before anything else happens.

  <li>An {{code|<a>}} gets removed if you backspace while the cursor is right
  after it, so the link disappears.

  <li>A {{code|<br>}} or {{code|<hr>}} or {{code|<img>}} gets deleted.

  <li>Backspacing at the start of most blocks merges with the previous block.
  (Visually, this is a matter of deleting a line break.)

  <li>Backspacing at the start of an <span>indentation element</span>, or an
  {{code|<li>}} or {{code|<dt>}} or {{code|<dd>}} that's at the beginning of a
  list, outdents the current block (rather than merging with the previous
  block).

  <li>Backspacing at the start of a table cell does nothing.

  <li>Backspacing immediately after a table selects the table, so a second
  backspace deletes it.

  <li>Backspacing at the start of a list item that's not at the beginning of a
  list merges with the previous list item, but keeps the contents on a separate
  line, so you have to hit backspace a second time to get them on the same
  line.
</ul>
</div>

<p class=comments>For all the deletions here, Firefox 7.0a2 will remove wrapper
elements like &lt;b> only if they're selected, like {&lt;b>foo&lt;/b>}.  IE9,
Chrome 14 dev, and Opera 11.50 will all remove them even if only their contents
are selected, like &lt;b>[foo]&lt;/b>.  Gecko's behavior in the latter case
leaves things like &lt;b>{}&lt;/b> in the DOM, which is unhelpful, so I don't.

  range</span>'s [[rangestart]] [[node]] and [[bpoffset]].

  <li>
  <p class=comments>First go up as high as possible within the current block,
  then drill down to the lowest possible level, in the hopes that we'll wind up
  at the end of a text node, or maybe in a br or hr.

  <p>Repeat the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li>
    <p class=comments> If there's an invisible node somewhere, Firefox 5.0a2
    removes that node and then stops, so each backspace removes one invisible
    node.  All others remove the invisible node and then continue on looking
    for something visible to remove.  The spec follows the latter behavior,
    since it makes more sense to the user.  Of course, the definition of
    "invisible node" is not necessarily anything like the spec's.

    <p>If <var>offset</var> is zero and <var>node</var>'s [[previoussibling]]
    is an <span>editable</span> <span>invisible</span> [[node]], remove
    <var>node</var>'s [[previoussibling]] from its [[parent]].

    <li>Otherwise, if <var>node</var> has a [[child]] with [[index]]
    <var>offset</var> &minus; 1 and that [[child]] is an <span>editable</span>
    <span>invisible</span> [[node]], remove that [[child]] from
    <var>node</var>, then subtract one from <var>offset</var>.

    <li>Otherwise, if <var>offset</var> is zero and <var>node</var> is an
    <span>inline node</span>, or if <var>node</var> is an
    <span>invisible</span> [[node]], set <var>offset</var> to the [[index]] of
    <var>node</var>, then set <var>node</var> to its [[parent]].

    <li>
    <p class=comments> When backspacing a link, Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev,
    Opera 11.50, and OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu have no special behavior.  IE9
    and Word 2007 remove the link instead of deleting its last character.  The
    latter behavior seems more useful and intuitive.

    <p>Otherwise, if <var>node</var> has a [[child]] with [[index]]
    <var>offset</var> &minus; 1 and that [[child]] is an <span>editable</span>
    [[a]], remove that [[child]] from <var>node</var>, <span>preserving its
    descendants</span>.  Then abort these steps.

    <li>Otherwise, if <var>node</var> has a [[child]] with [[index]]
    <var>offset</var> &minus; 1 and that [[child]] is not a <span>block
    node</span> or a [[br]] or an [[img]], set <var>node</var> to that
    [[child]], then set <var>offset</var> to the [[length]] of
    <var>node</var>.

    <li>Otherwise, break from this loop.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>At this point, node cannot be an invisible node.  There are three cases:

  <ol>
    <li><var>offset</var> is zero and node is a block node.  Then we'll usually
    merge with the previous block if one exists.

    <li><var>offset</var> is not zero, <var>node</var> is not a block node, and
    <var>node</var> does not have a child with index <var>offset</var> &minus;
    1.  The only way this is possible is if node has a length greater than zero
    but no children, which implies it's a text or comment or PI.  Comments and
    PIs are invisible nodes, so it must be a text node.  We delete the previous
    character.

    <li><var>offset</var> is not zero, and the child of <var>node</var> with
    index <var>offset</var> &minus; 1 is a block node or a br or an img.  Then
    we'll usually merge the <var>offset</var>th child of <var>node</var> with
    the last descendant of the <var>offset</var> &minus; 1st.
  </ol>

  <p>Unlike forwardDelete, there's no special case for diacritics.  This means
  backspacing will just delete the last combining diacritic typed, or the whole
  character if it's precomposed.  This matches everything I tested (IE9,
  Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev, etc.).
  </div>

  <p>If <var>node</var> is a [[text]] node and <var>offset</var> is not zero,
  or if <var>node</var> is a <span>block node</span> that has a [[child]] with
  [[index]] <var>offset</var> &minus; 1 and that [[child]] is a [[br]] or
  [[hr]] or [[img]]:

  <ol>
    <li>Call [[selcollapse|<var>node</var>, <var>offset</var>]] on the
    [[contextobject]]'s [[selection]].

    <li>Call [[extend|<var>node</var>, <var>offset</var> &minus; 1]] on the
    [[contextobject]]'s [[selection]].

    <li><span>Delete the selection</span>.

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <p class=comments>At the time of this writing, this should be impossible.
  Just being safe.

  <p>If <var>node</var> is an <span>inline node</span>, abort these steps.

  <li>
  <p class=comments> If we're at the beginning of a list, we want to outdent
  the first list item.  This doesn't actually match anyone or anything.  Word
  2007 and OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu just remove the list marker, which is
  weird and doesn't map well to HTML.  Browsers tend to just merge with the
  preceding block, which isn't expected.

  <p>If <var>node</var> is an [[li]] or [[dt]] or [[dd]] and is the first
  [[child]] of its [[parent]], and <var>offset</var> is zero:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>items</var> be a list of all [[li]]s that are
    [[ancestors]] of <var>node</var>.

    <li><span>Normalize sublists</span> of each <var>item</var> in
    <var>items</var>.

    <li><span>Record the values</span> of the one-[[node]] list consisting of
    <var>node</var>, and let <var>values</var> be the result.

    <li><span>Split the parent</span> of the one-[[node]] list consisting of
    <var>node</var>.

    <li><span>Restore the values</span> from <var>values</var>.

    <li>
    <p class=comments> Annoying hack to prevent the dl from being re-added when
    fixing disallowed ancestors.  In most cases we want a wrapper dl added, but
    in two cases (delete and insertParagraph) we're actually trying to outdent
    the list item.  TODO: there might be a better way to do this.

    <p>If <var>node</var> is a [[dd]] or [[dt]], and it is not an
    <span>allowed child</span> of any of its [[ancestors]] <span>in the same
    editing host</span>, <span>set the tag name</span> of <var>node</var> to
    the <span>default single-line container name</span> and let <var>node</var>
    be the result.

    <li><span>Fix disallowed ancestors</span> of <var>node</var>.

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <p class=comments>By this point, we're almost certainly going to merge
  something, and the only question is what.

  <p>Let <var>start node</var> equal <var>node</var> and let <var>start
  offset</var> equal <var>offset</var>.

  <li>Repeat the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li>If <var>start offset</var> is zero, set <var>start offset</var> to the
    [[index]] of <var>start node</var> and then set <var>start node</var> to
    its [[parent]].

    <li>Otherwise, if <var>start node</var> has an <span>editable</span>
    <span>invisible</span> [[child]] with [[index]] <var>start offset</var>
    minus one, remove it from <var>start node</var> and subtract one from
    <var>start offset</var>.

    <li>Otherwise, break from this loop.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <p class=comments>At the beginning of an indented block, outdent it, similar
  to a list item.  Browsers don't do this, word processors do.  Note: this
  copy-pastes from the outdent command action.

  <p>If <var>offset</var> is zero, and <var>node</var> has an
  <span>editable</span> [[inclusiveancestor]] <span>in the same editing
  host</span> that's an <span>indentation element</span>:

  <ol>
    <li><span>Block-extend</span> the [[range]] whose [[rangestart]] and
    [[rangeend]] are both (<var>node</var>, 0), and let <var>new range</var> be
    the result.

    <li>Let <var>node list</var> be a list of [[nodes]], initially empty.

    <li>For each [[node]] <var>current node</var> [[contained]] in <var>new
    range</var>, append <var>current node</var> to <var>node list</var> if the
    last member of <var>node list</var> (if any) is not an [[ancestor]] of
    <var>current node</var>, and <var>current node</var> is
    <span>editable</span> but has no <span>editable</span> [[descendants]].

    <li><span>Outdent</span> each [[node]] in <var>node list</var>.

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>This is to avoid stripping a line break from

    <pre>foo&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;table>&lt;tr>&lt;td>[]bar&lt;/table></pre>

  <p>and similarly for &lt;hr>.  We should just do nothing here.
  </div>

  <p>If the [[child]] of <var>start node</var> with [[index]] <var>start
  offset</var> is a [[table]], abort these steps.

  <li>
  <p class=comments>If you try backspacing into a table, select it.  This
  doesn't match any browser; it matches the recommendation of the "behavior
  when typing in contentEditable elements" document.  The idea is that then you
  can delete it with a second backspace.

  <p>If <var>start node</var> has a [[child]] with [[index]] <var>start
  offset</var> &minus; 1, and that [[child]] is a [[table]]:

  <ol>
    <li>Call [[selcollapse|<var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>
    &minus; 1]] on the [[contextobject]]'s [[selection]].

    <li>Call [[extend|<var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>]] on the

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>Special case:

<pre>
&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;br>&lt;p>[]bar&lt;/p>
-> &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;p>[]bar&lt;/p></pre>

  <p>and likewise for &lt;hr>.  But with &lt;img> we merge like in other cases:

<pre>
&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;img>&lt;p>[]bar&lt;/p>
-> &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;img>[]bar.</pre>

  <p>Browsers don't do this consistently.  Firefox 5.0a2 doesn't seem to do it
  at all.
  </div>

  <p>If <var>offset</var> is zero; and either the [[child]] of <var>start
  node</var> with [[index]] <var>start offset</var> minus one is an [[hr]], or
  the [[child]] is a [[br]] whose [[previoussibling]] is either a [[br]] or not
  an <span>inline node</span>:

  <ol>
    <li>Call [[selcollapse|<var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>
    &minus; 1]] on the [[contextobject]]'s [[selection]].

    <li>Call [[extend|<var>start node</var>, <var>start offset</var>]] on the

    <li>Abort these steps.
  </ol>

  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>If you try backspacing out of a list item, merge it with the previous
  item, but add a line break.  Then you have to backspace again if you really
  want them to be on the same line.  This matches Word 2007 and OpenOffice.org
  3.2.1 Ubuntu, and also matches "behavior when typing in contentEditable
  elements", but does not match any browser.

  <p>Note that this behavior is quite different from what happens if you
  actually select the linebreak in between the two lines.  In that case, the
  blocks are merged as normal.

  <p>Also note that hitting backspace twice will merge with the previous item.
  This matches OO.org, but Word will outdent the item on subsequent backspaces.
  Word's behavior doesn't fit well with the way lists work in HTML, and we
  probably don't want it.
  </div>

  <p>If the [[child]] of <var>start node</var> with [[index]] <var>start
  offset</var> is an [[li]] or [[dt]] or [[dd]], and that [[child]]'s
  [[firstchild]] is an <span>inline node</span>, and <var>start offset</var> is
  not zero:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>previous item</var> be the [[child]] of <var>start node</var>
    with [[index]] <var>start offset</var> minus one.

    <li>
    <p class=comments>If the last child is already a br, we only need to append
    one extra br.  Otherwise we need to append two, since the first will do
    nothing.

    <p>If <var>previous item</var>'s [[lastchild]] is an <span>inline
    node</span> other than a [[br]], call [[createelement|"br"]] on the

  </ol>

  <li>
  <p class=comments>When merging adjacent list items, make sure we only merge
  the items themselves, not any block children.  We want
  {{code|<li><p>foo<li><p>[]bar}} to become {{code|<li><p>foo<p>[]bar}}, not
  {{code|<li><p>foo<br>[]bar}} or {{code|<li><p>foo[]bar}}.  To do the
  deletion, we need to wipe out the current selection, so we save it as a
  range.  Saving it as a node/offset pair isn't enough, because it might be
  invalid after we do the deletion.  A range will update according to the range
  mutation rules.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>formatBlock</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=note>This command lets you change what block element particular lines
are wrapped in.  It will convert an existing wrapper if one exists, and
otherwise will create a new one.

<p>A <dfn>formattable block name</dfn> is "address", "dd", "div", "dt", "h1",
"h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6", "p", or "pre".

<div class=comments>
<p>Tested browser versions: IE9, Firefox 4.0, Chrome 13 dev, Opera 11.10.

<p>Firefox and Chrome will replace a &lt;blockquote> by a &lt;p> or other given
tag.  IE and Opera will nest the &lt;p> inside instead.  The latter makes more
sense, given that a) we don't support formatBlock with &lt;blockquote> and b)
&lt;blockquote>s are logically different, since they can contain many lines.

<p>Firefox will not convert other tags like &lt;p> to &lt;div>, it will only
wrap unwrapped lines in a &lt;div>.  Firefox also won't replace &lt;div> by
things like &lt;p>, it will nest the &lt;p> inside.  The spec follows other
browsers.

<p>If you try to convert a &lt;dt> to a &lt;div> or &lt;p> or such, Firefox
breaks out of the &lt;dl> entirely, leaving ...&lt;dt>&lt;br>&lt;/dt>&lt;/dl>.
Chrome will convert a &lt;dt> or &lt;dd> to the given element, leaving a
&lt;div> or &lt;p> or such as the child of a &lt;dl>.  I follow IE/Opera, which
only affect the contents of &lt;dt>/&lt;dd> (Firefox behaves this way for
&lt;dd> as well, just not &lt;dt>).  This means you can get invalid DOMs like
&lt;dt>&lt;p>foo&lt;p>&lt;/dt>, but they can be serialized as text/html, so I'm
not too fussy.

<p>When it comes to &lt;li>, IE/Opera behave like with &lt;dt>/&lt;dd>, which
is how I behave too.  Firefox apparently refuses to do anything.  Chrome tries
to wrap the parent list element, breaking it up if only some of the children
are selected; this produces unserializable DOMs if you're wrapping with &lt;p>.

<p>When you're converting multiple blocks at once, Chrome replaces them all by
one block with &lt;br> stuck in, like &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;p>bar&lt;/p> ->
&lt;div>foo&lt;br>bar&lt;/div>.  It wipes out intervening block containers too
in some cases.  This might make sense for &lt;address>/&lt;h*>/&lt;pre>, but
other browsers don't do it.

  &lt;h1>&lt;p>[foo]&lt;/p>&lt;br>bar&lt;/h1> or such.  It tries to
  heuristically distinguish between divs used as line-breakers and divs used as
  actual wrappers by checking if they have prohibited paragraph children as
  descendants.  It works for address too, in case there are paragraphs nested
  inside.  Thus &lt;address>[foo]&lt;br>bar&lt;/address> becomes

  &lt;address>[foo]&lt;p>bar&lt;/p>&lt;/address> becomes

  <div class=comments>
  <p>We have two different behaviors, one for div and p and one for everything
  else.  The basic difference is that for div and p, we assume that it should
  be one line per element, while for other elements, we put in multiple lines
  separated by &lt;br>.  So if you do formatBlock to p on
    <pre>&lt;div>foo&lt;/div>&lt;div>bar&lt;/div></pre>
  <p>or
    <pre>foo&lt;br>bar</pre>
  <p>you get
    <pre>&lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;p>bar&lt;/p></pre>
  <p>but formatBlock to h1 will get you
    <pre>&lt;h1>foo&lt;br>bar&lt;/h1>.</pre>
  <p>IE9 will just change the elements as they are, so it gives
  &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;p>bar&lt;/p> and &lt;h1>foo&lt;/h1>&lt;h1>bar&lt;/h1> for
  &lt;div>foo&lt;/div>&lt;div>bar&lt;/div>, but &lt;p>foo&lt;br>bar&lt;/p> and
  &lt;h1>foo&lt;br>bar&lt;/h1> for foo&lt;br>bar.  This is unreasonable,
  because the two possible inputs here look identical to the user and might
  have been produced by identical user input.

  <p>Firefox 5.0a2 will give results like &lt;p>foo&lt;/p>&lt;p>bar&lt;/p> or
  &lt;h1>foo&lt;/h1>&lt;h1>bar&lt;/h1> no matter what (modulo oddities in its
  handling of divs).  Opera 11.10 is similar, except it leaves a trailing
  &lt;br> in the first element.

  <p>Chrome 13 dev will give results like &lt;p>foo&lt;br>bar&lt;/p> or
  &lt;h1>foo&lt;br>bar&lt;/h1> no matter what.

      Chrome 14 dev leaves it alone and doesn't format it.  I follow
      Firefox/Opera just because it's the simplest given how I happen to have

<div class=comments>
<p>IE9 returns human-readable strings like "Normal" (p/div/etc.), "Formatted"

appropriate tag name in lowercase, or the empty string if there is no
appropriate tag.  Opera 11.11 behaves the same, but with uppercase.

<p>IE9 looks like it recognizes address, h*, pre, dd, dt, ol, ul, and dir, with
everything else registering as "Normal".  Firefox 6.0a2 recognizes only the
arguments it accepts for formatBlock, namely address, h*, p, and pre.  Chrome
14 dev recognizes address, div, h*, dd, dl, dt, p, pre plus lots of random
other stuff like blockquote and section.  I'll go with everything that
execCommand("formatblock") accepts as an argument, which at the time of this

<h3><dfn>The <code title>forwardDelete</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=note>This is the same as hitting the delete key (see <a

the same as <span>the <code title>delete</code> command</span>, except of
course backwards.  Also, some of the special cases for backspacing don't apply,
as noted in the comments.  The one special case you get when deleting forward
but not backward is that if the cursor is before a grapheme cluster that
consists of multiple characters, like a base character with combining
diacritics, we delete the diacritics too.  (Backspacing just deletes the last
diacritic, so you have to backspace several times to remove the whole cluster.)

    <div class=comments>
    <p>Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev, Word 2007, and OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Ubuntu
    act as the spec says, getting rid of all diacritics on forward delete.  IE9
    and Opera 11.50 have no special case and just delete the next character.  I
    go with Firefox/Chrome/Word/OO.

    <p>However, when I actually type in the text box as opposed to running
    semi-automated tests, IE9 has magical behavior: it replaces the base
    character with something that looks like &#x25cc; U+25CC DOTTED CIRCLE.
    Further strikes of the delete key remove the diacritics, and the circle
    vanishes along with the last of them.  I wasn't able to get it to actually
    replace the base character, so I'm not sure what the point is.  The circle
    doesn't seem to appear in the DOM, and apparently it disappears in some
    circumstances.  This might be worth standardizing somehow, I don't know.

    <p>TODO: The way we remove diacritics is probably not right.  We probably
    want to normalize to grapheme cluster boundaries, using UAX#29 or
    something.  We also need to handle non-BMP stuff.  The idea is that if the
    cursor is before a character that precedes a combining mark, you need to
    delete the combining mark too.

<div class=comments>
<dl>
  <dt>IE9
  <dd>Outputs &lt;blockquote style="margin-right: 0px" dir="ltr">, or when
  surrounding RTL blocks, &lt;blockquote style="margin-left: 0px" dir="rtl">.
  The direction seems to go by the end of the selection.  The presence of the
  dir attribute means that any contents that were inheriting a different dir
  from an ancestor get their direction changed as a side effect, but if they
  actually have the opposite dir specified, they won't appear to be indented.
  It doesn't reset top or bottom margins on the blockquote, so it adds them.
  If it's not wrapping a block element, like if it's only wrapping up until a
  &lt;br>, it adds a &lt;p>.

  <dt>Firefox 4.0
  <dd>In styleWithCSS mode, adds style="margin-left: 40px" to the appropriate
  block container (or margin-right if it's RTL).  If there's no appropriate
  block container, adds a div.  If multiple blocks are affected, it goes by the
  direction of the block whose style it's changing, which winds up being wrong
  for descendants with different direction.  In non-styleWithCSS mode, uses
  &lt;blockquote>, so it indents on both sides and also adds top/bottom
  margins.

  <dt>Chrome 12 dev
  <dd>Outputs &lt;blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0
  0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px"> in both modes for both LTR and RTL
  (which is broken for RTL, since it indents only on the left).

  <dt>Opera 11.00
  <dd>Outputs &lt;blockquote>, so it indents on both sides and on the
  top/bottom.
</dl>

<p>For repeated indentation, everyone except Opera that outputs
&lt;blockquote>s just puts them at the outermost possible location, which works
well.  Opera puts them in the innermost position, which is broken, because it
will even put them inside &lt;p> (which will not round-trip through text/html
serialization).

<p>Gecko in CSS mode messes up by adding margins even to things like
&lt;blockquote> that already have margins from CSS rules, instead of nesting a
div, so it doesn't actually increase the indentation.  However, if an element
has an explicit left margin (assuming LTR), it will increase the margin to
80px, so it works with WebKit's blockquotes.

<p>We have two strategies for handling directionality: always indent on both
sides (Firefox non-CSS, Opera) or try to figure out heuristically which side we
want (IE, Firefox CSS).  The latter approach is only possible by adding extra
markup and complexity, so for now we'll take the easy way out and go with just
indenting on both sides.

<p>This reasoning doesn't discuss lists.  For research on lists, see the
comment for <a href=#the-insertorderedlist-command>insertOrderedList</a>.  List
handling is more complicated and I wound up differing from all browsers in lots
of ways.

  <p class=comments>IE9 and Chrome 13 dev seem to never break up any ancestors,

  Firefox 5.0a2 acts the most sensibly: it only breaks up things like &lt;p> or
  &lt;b> that shouldn't contain &lt;hr>.  The spec goes with Firefox here
  (although the list of what to break up isn't precisely identical).

<div class=comments>
<p>Not supported by IE9.  Handling of disallowed children is interesting:

<dl>
  <dt>Firefox 5.0a2
  <dd>Will allow &lt;dt> inside &lt;dt> (doesn't serialize).  If you try
  inserting dir/ol/ul inside an existing dir/ol/ul, it will strip the list
  element and leave only the li's, so inserting &lt;ul>&lt;li>abc&lt;/ul> into
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>f[o]o&lt;/ol> creates
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>f&lt;li>abc&lt;li>o&lt;/ol>.  &lt;dt>/&lt;dd>/&lt;li> that
  don't descend from a list will be left alone, not converted to &lt;p>.  Empty
  elements seem not to be inserted.  &lt;li> will get put inside &lt;p>, which
  breaks serialization.  Nothing is allowed inside &lt;xmp>, not even text.

  <dt>Chrome 13 dev
  <dd>Inserting a &lt;p> into a &lt;p> or &lt;li> or such will remove the child
  &lt;p>, adding its contents to the parent instead.  Adding an &lt;li> or
  &lt;hr> as the child of a &lt;p> works, as does an &lt;a> inside an &lt;a>,
  &lt;h2> inside &lt;h1>, &lt;li> inside &lt;li>, &lt;nobr> inside &lt;nobr>,
  &lt;b> inside &lt;xmp>, etc. (all unserializable).  But &lt;dt> and &lt;dd>
  seem to get converted to their contents like &lt;p>.
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>abc&lt;/ol> inside &lt;ol>&lt;li>f[o]o&lt;/ol> becomes
  &lt;ol>&lt;li>f&lt;li>abc&lt;li>&lt;li>o&lt;/ol>, interestingly (note the
  empty &lt;li>).  I don't understand how it works, but it doesn't seem to make
  much sense.

  <dt>Opera 11.11
  <dd>Seems to do almost no validity or serialization checks, except that it
  prevents &lt;a> inside &lt;a>, &lt;nobr> inside &lt;nobr>, and block elements
  inside inline elements.  Interestingly, most of the places where it's
  non-serializable per HTML parsing are actually serializable in Opera's own
  parser.

  so and doesn't insert a &lt;br>, so the paragraph collapses; Opera 11.50

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Similar logic to createLink, except even more compelling,

  the current HTML spec instructs UAs to not even try displaying the image, and

  nothing on an empty string, but the other three browsers I tested stick in

  <p>If <var>value</var> is the empty string, abort these steps and do

  <li>
  <p class=comments>Firefox 7.0a2 seems to strip the wrapper or not depending

  &lt;b>[foo]&lt;/b> no.  Chrome 14 dev seems to strip the wrapper regardless.
  Opera 11.50 seems to keep the wrapper, but place the image outside it.  I
  didn't get IE to cooperate with my tests.  I chose to leave wrappers across
  the board because they might be meaningful: e.g., a background-color when the
  image is small or not fully opaque.

<p>Firefox 6.0a2 doesn't notice if you're trying to put the &lt;br> in a bad

<h3><dfn>The <code title>insertParagraph</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=note>
<p>This is the same as hitting enter (see <a
href=#additional-requirements>Additional requirements</a>).  The general rule
is that we find the nearest <span>single-line container</span> ancestor, clone
it and insert the clone after it, and then move all the contents after the
cursor (along with the cursor itself) to the clone.  But there are a few
special cases:

<ul>
  <li>If we can't find a single-line container to use, first we wrap the
  current line in a new container with the <span>default single-line container
  name</span>.

  <li>For <code title>&lt;address></code>, <code title>&lt;listing></code>, and
  <code title>&lt;pre></code>, we add a <code title>&lt;br></code> instead of
  cloning it.  These are all elements that are meant to contain multiple lines,
  not have one line per element.

  <li>If the cursor is in a list item with no contents, hitting enter breaks
  out of the list entirely, outdenting the current item.  This means that if
  you're in a list, you can hit enter twice to break out.

  <li>If the cursor is at the end of a heading, hitting enter doesn't make a
  new heading, it switches to the <span>default single-line container
  name</span>.

  <li>If the cursor is at the end of a <code title>&lt;dt></code> or <code
  title>&lt;dd></code>, the new element is the opposite type, so you naturally
  switch between entering terms and definitions.
</ul>
</div>

<div class=comments>
<p>There are three major behaviors here.  Firefox 5.0a2 behaves identically to
execCommand("formatBlock", false, "p"), which is not really useful.  IE9
actually just overwrites the selection with an empty paragraph element, which
seems not very useful either.  Chrome 13 dev and Opera 11.10 behave basically
the same as if the user hit the Return key.  This latter behavior seems much
more useful, even though it's horribly misnamed, so it's what I'll spec.
Comments about IE/Firefox are based on manual tests, where I hit Enter instead
of running commands.

<p>(Actually, Opera doesn't behave quite the same for insertParagraph and line
breaks.  But it's pretty close, and I expect the differences are bugs.)

<p>Then, of course, we have several flavors of line-breaking behavior to choose
from.  Firefox prefers &lt;br>s, unless it's in the middle of a &lt;p> or
something.  Opera and IE like &lt;p>.  Chrome prefers &lt;div>.  And there are
lots of subtleties besides.  I go with IE/Opera-style behavior, as discussed in

  Firefox 5.0a2 and Opera 11.10 insert a &lt;br> instead, treating it

  most sense is to just insert an actual newline character, though, since this

  <p>IE9 and Chrome 13 dev also break &lt;address> up into multiple

  formatBlock candidates inside one another, so I'll go with Firefox.

  <p>listing and xmp work the same as pre in all browsers.  For Firefox and

<h3><dfn>The <code title>insertText</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=note>
<p>This is the same as typing text (see <a
href=#additional-requirements>Additional requirements</a>).  If the input
string is more than one character, first we split it up into one execution per
character, for simplicity.  The general rule is then that we record each
command's <span>state override</span> or <span>value override</span>, insert
the new character and select it, restore any overrides that we saved, and
collapse the selection to its end.

<p>The idea of the override business is that the user might run a command like
bold when the selection is collapsed.  There's nothing to bold in that case,
but if the user runs bold and then types a character, they expect it to be
bold.  Thus we save the requested state in an override and restore it when the
user types.  Deleting things can also set overrides, if the deleted text was
styled.

<p>Whitespace is a special case.  The note for <a
href=#canonical-space-sequences>canonical space sequences</a> gives some of the
background.  If the user tries typing a space, we make it non-breaking so it
doesn't collapse with anything, then canonicalize whitespace around the
insertion point so line breaking isn't adversely affected.

<p>One last special case is a newline.  For that we just pass off to <span>the
<code title>insertParagraph</code> command</span>.
</div>

<div class=comments>
<p>Supported only by WebKit.  Tests in other browsers were manual.

<p>TODO: This doesn't work well if the input contains things that aren't
supposed to appear in HTML, like carriage returns or nulls.  Nor is it going to
work well if the current cursor position is in between two halves of a non-BMP
character.  This will result in unserializability.  The current spec disregards
this, as Chrome 14 dev does.  (It's not relevant to other browsers, since they
don't support this as a command.)

<p>Important issue: non-breaking space fun!  The issue: if the user hits space
twice, they expect it to create two spaces, not collapse.  Also, if they're at
the beginning or end of a line and hit space, again, they expect it not to
collapse.  Since we don't want to require that all contenteditable element
contents always be used only with white-space: pre-wrap, we need to convert to
and from non-breaking spaces.

<p>But there's a catch: you can't just make spaces non-breaking willy-nilly,
because that doesn't just stop the space from collapsing, it also prevents
breaking.  (Chrome 14 dev actually cheats here: in contenteditable, it doesn't
collapse nbsp, but breaks after it like a regular space.)  The upshot of this
is that any nbsp needs to be followed by a space, or else it might end up at
the beginning of a line and be visible there; and it needs to be preceded by a
space, or else it might break a line prematurely.  How to achieve both of these
goals when there are an even number of spaces to display is left as an exercise
for the reader.

<p>Browsers vary greatly in how they handle all this, of course!

<p>The basic philosophy of IE9 is that if you're inserting a space, and one or
both of the neighboring characters is a space, change the neighboring
characters to non-breaking spaces.  This breaks if one of the neighboring
characters is part of a run of collapsed whitespace: "foo  []bar" becomes "foo
&amp;nbsp; []bar", which converts one visible space to three.

<p>Firefox 6.0a2 will sometimes convert the space you're inserting to an nbsp,
sometimes convert neighboring spaces to nbsps, and sometimes convert
neighboring nbsps to spaces.  I cannot discern any clear reason to when it
chooses what, except that it seems to prefer runs of nbsp's followed by a
single space (although not always).  I didn't find any outright bugs, except
the inevitable ones like nbsp's sometimes being right after letters.

<p>Chrome 14 dev tries to normalize everything to look like " &amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp; ...", alternating with space then nbsp.  Unfortunately, it does so
buggily, because it converts collapsed spaces to nbsp's, so inserting a space
before " " makes it into " &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;", which changes one visible
space to four (or arbitrarily many).

<p>Opera 11.11 has varying behavior, like Firefox and Chrome.  Like Firefox, I
didn't discern an obvious pattern.

<p>This was all <a href=http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-June/032187.html>discussed</a>.

<p>Unfortunately, we're stuck with this nbsp stuff, because of 1) legacy
reasons, 2) mail clients might not support CSS equivalents, 3) authors might
not know to apply any CSS to wherever the content is eventually used.  The
behavior I decided on to minimize the evil is as follows:

<ul>
  <li>If the first and last spaces are in non-collapsing positions, two spaces
  is nbsp+space, three is space+nbsp+space, four or more is space+nbsp followed
  by the pattern for two less.

  <li>If the first space has to be an nbsp so it doesn't collapse, three is
  instead nbsp+nbsp+space, four or more is nbsp+space followed by the pattern
  for two less.

  <li>If the last space has to be nbsp, two is space+nbsp, three is
  space+nbsp+nbsp, four or more is space+nbsp followed by the pattern for two
  less.

  <li>If the first and last space must both be nbsp, two is nbsp+nbsp, three is
  nbsp+space+nbsp, four or more nbsp+space followed by the pattern for two
  less.
</ul>

<p>This avoids nbsp at the end of a run except where it's needed, so words
won't appear indented if they wrap to the next line.  It avoids more than two
nbsp's in a row, so there won't be huge chunks of space that get wrapped all at
once.  And it avoids nbsp at the beginning of a run except where it's needed or
if there are only two spaces in the run, so words won't have to wrap
unnecessarily.

<p>This is still a huge headache, though.
</div>

<p><span>Action</span>:

<ol>
  <li>
  <div class=comments>
  <p>Chrome 14 dev does the deletion even if the value is empty.  Of course,
  other browsers don't expose this as an execCommand(), so no one else has any
  defined behavior in this case at all, so I follow Chrome.

  <p>IE9, Firefox 7.0a2, Chrome 14 dev, and Opera 11.50 all don't strip
  wrappers, except that as usual, Gecko does if you select the whole wrapper,
  like {&lt;b>foo&lt;/b>}.  Also, Chrome 14 dev seems to strip the wrapper and
  try recreating the style in cases like &lt;b>[foo&lt;/b>bar], where it starts
  in a wrapper but ends after it; this doesn't always work so well, so I don't
  do it.  Firefox 7.0a2 also has the deletion set overrides for indeterminate
  state commands, so if you run insertText on [foo&lt;b>bar&lt;/b>baz] it will
  make the result bold.

  <p>These things don't make any sense to me, so I don't do them.  I set
  overrides based on the first editable text node in the range when deleting;
  preserve any wrappers at the start of the range; and restore the overrides in
  case preserving the wrappers isn't enough (like if they weren't set by
  deletion at all).  This behavior seems to closely match IE9.

<p>As a general rule, ignoring nodes with children saves us from treating

indeterminate.  Chrome 14 dev seems to only pay attention to text nodes,
instead, or something like that.  At any rate, it fails on images.  Firefox
6.0a2 (for state and value) gets tripped up by examples like the one given.

<div class=comments>
<p>IE9 throws exceptions in almost every case when querying the state of
justify*, and Opera 11.11 returns false in every case except some seemingly
random crazy ones.

<p>Firefox 6.0a2 returns true for the state of justify* if anything in the
range has the right alignment, not if everything does.  This isn't consistent
with how state works for the inline commands, nor with WebKit.

<p>Chrome 14 dev counts text-align on inline elements, which is wrong, because
the property has no effect.  It also counts it on non-editable elements, which
is wrong, because then the state for justify* wouldn't necessarily be true
after executing it.  (Chrome actually does align the non-editable elements, but
that's just a bug.)  Chrome further returns false for justify* if the
justification is just the default inherited justification, e.g., left for LTR.
This doesn't seem to make sense either.

<p>State is kind of redundant here, because it's true if and only if
indeterminate is false and the value is equal to the desired value.  However,
I'll support it anyway, since Gecko/WebKit do.

<p class=comments>Not bidi-safe, but it's a pretty marginal corner case where
it fails.  Firefox 6.0a2 behaves weirdly here: it keys off the start node of
the active range, even if that's not contained.  Thus {&lt;div
align=center>foo&lt;/div>} has value "left" and indeterminate false, which
would suggest that the whole selection is aligned left, but that's not the

  <p>should become

    <pre>foo&lt;ul>&lt;li>bar&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></pre>

  <p>not

    <pre>foo&lt;ol>&lt;li>bar&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>.</pre>

<h3><dfn>The <code title>copy</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=comments>IE9 supports copy/cut/paste with a security warning.  Firefox
reportedly only supports it if you set a pref.  I didn't find info on other
browsers, but in my tests it didn't do anything.  I'm not going to try speccing
it unless implementers are interested in working out the security problems and
trying to get interop.  It seems like as of June 2011, everyone just <a
href=http://code.google.com/p/zeroclipboard/>uses Flash for this</a>.  So it
would be nice if we could work out a more secure standardized substitute.

<p><span>Action</span>: The user agent must either copy the current selection
to the clipboard as though the user had requested it, or [[throw]] a
[[SecurityError]] exception.  This specification does not define exactly how the
selection is to be copied to the clipboard, but the <a
href=http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/clipops/clipops.html>Clipboard API and
events</a> specification might be useful.

<p>User agents should exercise caution in respecting this <span>command</span>,
because sites could abuse it to confuse and annoy the user by overwriting the
clipboard with extremely long, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content.

<p class=comments>The idea is sites might catch the SECURITY_ERR and treat it
differently from NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, like encouraging users to reconfigure their
browser.  However, browsers might not want to encourage authors to tell users
to reconfigure their browser insecurely.

<p>User agents may choose not to <span title=supported>support</span> this
<span>command</span> at all.  If a user agent will only honor the
<span>command</span> for some whitelisted sites depending on configuration, it
may either [[throw]] a [[SecurityError]] exception for non-whitelisted sites,
or it may act as though the <span>command</span> is <span
title=supported>unsupported</span> on those sites.

<!-- @} -->
<h3><dfn>The <code title>selectAll</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=XXX>This is totally broken: if executed inside an editing host, it has
to select the editing host contents, not the whole document.  See <a
href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13840>bug</a>.

<div class=comments>
<p>Tested using roughly <a href=http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/1018>this</a>.

<dl>
  <dt>IE9
  <dd>A bit confusing.  The gist seems to be that it does selectAllChildren()
  on the body, except sometimes it doesn't.

  <dt>Firefox 5.0a2
  <dd>Throws an exception if nothing in the document is editable, which
  apparently it always does for execCommand().  If there's a body, it does
  selectAllChildren() on that, and otherwise it does selectAllChildren() on the
  root element.  If there's no root element, throws an exception.

  <dt>Chrome 13 dev
  <dd>If there's no root element, removes the selection.  If there's a root
  element but no body, collapses the selection at (document, 0).  If there's a
  body, it selects all the contents of the body, although that doesn't mean the
  resulting anchor or focus actually are the body node (they're usually text
  nodes).  But it seems to *avoid* selecting contenteditable stuff: if all the
  visible things in the body are contenteditable, it removes all ranges from
  the selection, and if some are, it freaks out and behaves oddly.  But
  designMode doesn't trouble it.

  <dt>Opera 11.11
  <dd>Was characteristically uncooperative in my tests, and I didn't try to
  investigate further.
</dl>

<p>The behavior here is relatively simple and largely matches implementations.

  <p class=comments>TODO: Is this right even for framesets?

<h3><dfn>The <code title>styleWithCSS</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=comments>
<p>IE9 and Opera 11.00 don't support this command.  By and large, they act the
way Gecko and WebKit do when styleWithCSS is off.  Gecko invented it, and
WebKit also <a href=https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13490>supports</a>
it.  The default in Firefox 4.0 is off, while all other browsers behave like
the default is on (and IE/Opera give no way to turn it off), so I default it to
on.

<p>Handling of <var>value</var> matches Firefox 5.0a2.  Chrome 13 dev treats
the case-sensitive string "true" as true, the case-sensitive string "false" as
false, and does nothing for any other string.  I went with Gecko because this
way there are only two possible effects, not three, which makes it easier to
reason about and debug.  Also, Gecko made up the command, so this is probably
more web-compatible.  Cursory searches of Google Code and GitHub suggest that
authors almost always pass a boolean as the third argument when using
styleWithCSS, in which case the two behaviors work the same.
</div>

<p><span>Action</span>: If <var>value</var> is an <span
data-anolis-spec=domcore>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string
"false", set the <span>CSS styling flag</span> to false.  Otherwise, set the
<span>CSS styling flag</span> to true.

<p class=comments>This follows Chrome 13 dev.  Firefox 5.0a2 doesn't support
queryCommandState() for styleWithCSS.

<p><span>State</span>: True if the <span>CSS styling flag</span> is true,
otherwise false.

<h3><dfn>The <code title>undo</code> command</dfn></h3>

<p><span>Action</span>: As defined by the <a

<!-- @} -->
<h3><dfn>The <code title>useCSS</code> command</dfn></h3>
<!-- @{ -->
<div class=comments>
<p>Supported by Firefox 4.0, but not IE9 or Opera 11.00 (which don't support
styleWithCSS either), nor by Chrome 12 dev (which does support styleWithCSS).
useCSS was the original feature in Mozilla 1.3, but the meaning is backward, so
Gecko added styleWithCSS as a replacement.  No state is defined, since only
Gecko supports useCSS at all, and as of Firefox 6.0a2, it doesn't support
queryCommandState() for it.

<p>As of September 2011, WebKit is <a
href=https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36683>adding support</a> for this
command, so it can no longer be considered deprecated.
</div>

<p><span>Action</span>: If <var>value</var> is an <span
data-anolis-spec=domcore>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the string
"false", set the <span>CSS styling flag</span> to true.  Otherwise, set the
<span>CSS styling flag</span> to false.

<p>Since the effect of this command is the opposite of what one would expect,
user agents are encouraged to point authors to <code title="the stylewithcss
command">styleWithCSS</code> when <code title="the usecss
command">useCSS</code> is used, such as by logging a warning to an error
console.

<p class=note>No <span>state</span> is defined for this command, so <code
title=queryCommandState()>queryCommandState("useCSS")</code> must always return
false.  To query the <span>CSS styling flag</span>'s current value, authors
have to use <span>the <code title>styleWithCSS</code> command</span>.

<h2>Additional requirements</h2>
<!-- @{ -->
<p class=XXX>It has been <a
href=http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-December/024628.html>suggested</a>
that some things here need to be platform-dependent, not fully standardized.
For now I'm standardizing them anyway, because the large majority of behavior
should be platform-agnostic.  If anyone has suggestions as to particular things
that should be left up to platform behavior, please say so.

<p>When the user instructs the user agent to insert a line break inside an
<span>editing host</span>, such as by pressing the Enter key while the cursor
is in an <span>editable</span> [[node]], the user agent must take the
<span>action</span> for <span>the <code title>insertParagraph</code>
command</span>.

<p>When the user instructs the user agent to insert a line break inside an
<span>editing host</span> without breaking out of the current block, such as by
pressing Shift-Enter or Option-Enter while the cursor is in an
<span>editable</span> [[node]], the user agent must take the
<span>action</span> for <span>the <code title>insertLineBreak</code>
command</span>.

<p>When the user instructs the user agent to delete the previous character
inside an <span>editing host</span>, such as by pressing the Backspace key
while the cursor is in an <span>editable</span> [[node]], the user agent must
take the <span>action</span> for <span>the <code title>delete</code>
command</span>.

<p>When the user instructs the user agent to delete the next character inside
an <span>editing host</span>, such as by pressing the Delete key while the
cursor is in an <span>editable</span> [[node]], the user agent must take the
<span>action</span> for <span>the <code title>forwardDelete</code>
command</span>.

<p>When the user instructs the user agent to insert text inside an
<span>editing host</span>, such as by typing on the keyboard while the cursor
is in an <span>editable</span> [[node]], the user agent must take the
<span>action</span> for <span>the <code title>insertText</code> command</span>,
with <var>value</var> equal to the text the user provided.  If the user inserts
multiple characters at once or in quick succession, this specification does not
define whether it is treated as one insertion or several consecutive
insertions.

<p class=comments><a
href=http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13938>Bug 13938</a>.

<p>The user agent may allow the user to make other changes to editable content,
such as causing Ctrl-B to execute <span>the <code title>bold</code>
command</span>.  Any such change should take the <span>action</span> for some
<span>command</span> defined by this specification, if possible.
